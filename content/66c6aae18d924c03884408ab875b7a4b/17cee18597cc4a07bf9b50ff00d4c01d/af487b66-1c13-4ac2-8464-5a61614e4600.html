  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">The cybersecurity professionals must have proper knowledge about various possible threat actors and their tactics related to cyber threats, mostly called Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). This understanding of IoCs helps security professionals quickly detect the threats entering the organization and protect the organization from evolving threats. For this purpose, IoCs are divided into four categories:</p><p><strong>Email Indicators</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Attackers usually prefer email services to send malicious data to the target organization or individual. Such socially engineered emails are preferred due to their ease of use and comparative anonymity. Examples of email indicators include the senderâ€™s email address, email subject, and attachments or links.</p><p><strong>Network Indicators</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Network indicators are useful for command and control, malware delivery, and identifying details about the operating system, browser type, and other computer-specific information. Examples of network indicators include URLs, domain names, and IP addresses.</p><p><strong>Host-Based Indicators</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Host-based indicators are found by performing an analysis of the infected system within the organizational network. Examples of host-based indicators include filenames, file hashes, registry keys, DLLs, and mutex.</p><p><strong>Behavioral Indicators</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Generally, typical IoCs are useful for identifying indications of intrusion, such as malicious IP addresses, virus signatures, MD5 hash, and domain names. Behavioral IoCs are used to identify specific behavior related to malicious activities such as code injection into the memory or running the scripts of an application. Well-defined behaviors enable broad protection to block all current and future malicious activities. These indicators are useful to identify when legitimate system services are used for abnormal or unexpected activities. Examples of behavioral indicators include document executing PowerShell script, and remote command execution.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Listed below are some of the key Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Unusual outbound network traffic</li><li>Unusual activity through a privileged user account</li><li>Illegitimate files and software</li><li>Geographical anomalies</li><li>Multiple login failures</li><li>Increased database read volume</li><li>Large HTML response size</li><li>Multiple requests for the same file</li><li>Mismatched port-application traffic</li><li>Unusual usage of ports and protocols</li><li>Suspicious registry or system file changes</li><li>Unusual DNS requests</li><li>Malicious emails</li><li>Unexpected patching of systems</li><li>Signs of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) activity</li><li>Service interruption and the defacement</li><li>Bundles of data in the wrong places</li><li>Web traffic with superhuman behavior</li><li>A drastic increase in bandwidth usage</li><li>Malicious hardware</li></ul></div>
