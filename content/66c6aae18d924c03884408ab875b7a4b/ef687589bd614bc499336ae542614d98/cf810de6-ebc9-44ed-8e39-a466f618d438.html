  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Security experts broadly categorize computer crimes into two categories: crimes facilitated by a computer and those in which the computer is the target.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Ethical hacking is a structured and organized security assessment, usually as part of a penetration test or security audit, and is a crucial component of risk assessment, auditing, counter fraud, and information systems security best practices. It is used to identify risks and highlight remedial actions. It is also used to reduce Information and Communications Technology (ICT) costs by resolving vulnerabilities.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Ethical hackers determine the scope of the security assessment according to the client’s security concerns. Many ethical hackers are members of a “Tiger Team.” A tiger team works together to perform a full-scale test covering all aspects of the network, as well as physical and system intrusion.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">An ethical hacker should know the penalties of unauthorized hacking into a system. No ethical hacking activities associated with a network-penetration test or security audit should begin before receiving a signed legal document giving the ethical hacker express permission to perform the hacking activities from the target organization. Ethical hackers must be judicious with their hacking skills and recognize the consequences of misusing those skills.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The ethical hacker must follow certain rules to fulfill their ethical and moral obligations. They must do the following:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Gain authorization from the client and have a signed contract giving the tester permission to perform the test.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Maintain confidentiality when performing the test and follow a Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA) with the client for the confidential information disclosed during the test. The information gathered might contain sensitive information, and the ethical hacker must not disclose any information about the test or the confidential company data to a third party.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Perform the test up to but not beyond the agreed-upon limits. For example, ethical hackers should perform DoS attacks only if they have previously agreed upon this with the client. Loss of revenue, goodwill, and worse consequences could befall an organization whose servers or applications are unavailable to customers because of the testing.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">The following steps provide a framework for performing a security audit of an organization, which will help in ensuring that the test is organized, efficient, and ethical:</p><ul><li>Talk to the client and discuss the needs to be addressed during the testing</li><li>Prepare and sign NDA documents with the client</li><li>Organize an ethical hacking team and prepare the schedule for testing</li><li>Conduct the test</li><li>Analyze the results of the testing and prepare a report</li><li>Present the report findings to the client</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">However, there are limitations too. Unless the businesses first know what they are looking for and why they are hiring an outside vendor to hack their systems in the first place, chances are there would not be much to gain from experience. An ethical hacker, thus, can only help the organization to better understand its security system. It is up to the organization to place the right safeguards on the network.</p></div>
