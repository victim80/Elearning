  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">As technology is growing at a faster pace, so is the growth in the risks associated with it. To beat a hacker, it is necessary to think like one!</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Ethical hacking is necessary as it allows to counter attacks from malicious hackers by anticipating methods used by them to break into a system. Ethical hacking helps to predict various possible vulnerabilities well in advance and rectify them without incurring any kind of outside attack. As hacking involves creative thinking, vulnerability testing, and security audits alone cannot ensure that the network is secure. To achieve security, organizations must implement a “defense-in-depth” strategy by penetrating their networks to estimate and expose vulnerabilities.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Reasons why organizations recruit ethical hackers</strong></p><ul><li>To prevent hackers from gaining access to the organization’s information systems</li><li>To uncover vulnerabilities in systems and explore their potential as a risk</li><li>To analyze and strengthen an organization’s security posture, including policies, network protection infrastructure, and end-user practices</li><li>To provide adequate preventive measures in order to avoid security breaches</li><li>To help safeguard the customer data</li><li>To enhance security awareness at all levels in a business</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">An ethical hacker’s evaluation of a client’s information system security seeks to answer three basic questions:</p><p><strong>What can an attacker see on the target system?</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Normal security checks by system administrators will often overlook vulnerabilities. The ethical hacker has to think about what an attacker might see during the reconnaissance and scanning phases of an attack.</p><p><strong>What can an intruder do with that information?</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The ethical hacker must discern the intent and purpose behind attacks to determine appropriate countermeasures. During the gaining-access and maintaining-access phases of an attack, the ethical hacker needs to be one step ahead of the hacker in order to provide adequate protection.</p><p><strong>Are the attackers’ attempts being noticed on the target systems?</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes attackers will try to breach a system for days, weeks, or even months. Other times they will gain access but will wait before doing anything damaging. Instead, they will take the time to assess the potential use of exposed information. During the reconnaissance and covering tracks phases, the ethical hacker should notice and stop the attack.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">After carrying out attacks, hackers may clear their tracks by modifying log files and creating backdoors, or by deploying trojans. Ethical hackers must investigate whether such activities have been recorded and what preventive measures have been taken. This not only provides them with an assessment of the attacker’s proficiency but also gives them insight into the existing security measures of the system being evaluated. The entire process of ethical hacking and subsequent patching of discovered vulnerabilities depends on questions such as:</p><ul><li>What is the organization trying to protect?</li><li>Against whom or what are they trying to protect it?</li><li>Are all the components of the information system adequately protected, updated, and patched?</li><li>How much time, effort, and money is the client willing to invest to gain adequate protection?</li><li>Do the information security measures comply with industry and legal standards?</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">Sometimes, in order to save on resources or prevent further discovery, the client might decide to end the evaluation after the first vulnerability is found; therefore, it is important that the ethical hacker and the client work out a suitable framework for investigation beforehand. The client must be convinced of the importance of these security exercises through concise descriptions of what is happening and what is at stake. The ethical hacker must also remember to convey to the client that it is never possible to guard systems completely, but that they can always be improved.</p></div>
