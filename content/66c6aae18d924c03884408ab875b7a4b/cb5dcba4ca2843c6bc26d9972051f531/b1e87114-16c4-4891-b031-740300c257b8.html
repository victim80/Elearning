  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p><strong>Reconnaissance</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">An adversary performs reconnaissance to collect as much information about the target as possible to probe for weak points before actually attacking. They look for information such as publicly available information on the Internet, network information, system information, and the organizational information of the target. By conducting reconnaissance across different network levels, the adversary can gain information such as network blocks, specific IP addresses, and employee details. The adversary may use automated tools such as open ports and services, vulnerabilities in applications, and login credentials, to obtain information. Such information can help the adversary in gaining backdoor access to the target network.</p><p>Activities of the adversary include the following:</p><ul><li>Gathering information about the target organization by searching the Internet or through social engineering</li><li>Performing analysis of various online activities and publicly available information</li><li>Gathering information from social networking sites and web services</li><li>Obtaining information about websites visited</li><li>Monitoring and analyzing the target organization’s website</li><li>Performing Whois, DNS, and network footprinting</li><li>Performing scanning to identify open ports and services</li></ul><p><strong>Weaponization</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The adversary analyzes the data collected in the previous stage to identify the vulnerabilities and techniques that can exploit and gain unauthorized access to the target organization. Based on the vulnerabilities identified during analysis, the adversary selects or creates a tailored deliverable malicious payload (remote-access malware weapon) using an exploit and a backdoor to send it to the victim. An adversary may target specific network devices, operating systems, endpoint devices, or even individuals within the organization to carry out their attack. For example, the adversary may send a phishing email to an employee of the target organization, which may include a malicious attachment such as a virus or worm that, when downloaded, installs a backdoor on the system that allows remote access to the adversary.</p><p>The following are the activities of the adversary:</p><ul><li>Identifying appropriate malware payload based on the analysis</li><li>Creating a new malware payload or selecting, reusing, modifying the available malware payloads based on the identified vulnerability</li><li>Creating a phishing email campaign</li><li>Leveraging exploit kits and botnets</li></ul><p><strong>Delivery</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The previous stage included creating a weapon. Its payload is transmitted to the intended victim(s) as an email attachment, via a malicious link on websites, or through a vulnerable web application or USB drive. Delivery is a key stage that measures the effectiveness of the defense strategies implemented by the target organization based on whether the intrusion attempt of the adversary is blocked or not.</p><p>The following are the activities of the adversary:</p><ul><li>Sending phishing emails to employees of the target organization</li><li>Distributing USB drives containing malicious payload to employees of the target organization</li><li>Performing attacks such as watering hole on the compromised website</li><li>Implementing various hacking tools against the operating systems, applications, and servers of the target organization</li></ul><p><strong>Exploitation</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">After the weapon is transmitted to the intended victim, exploitation triggers the adversary’s malicious code to exploit a vulnerability in the operating system, application, or server on a target system. At this stage, the organization may face threats such as authentication and authorization attacks, arbitrary code execution, physical security threats, and security misconfiguration.</p><p>Activities of the adversary include the following:</p><ul><li>Exploiting software or hardware vulnerabilities to gain remote access to the target system</li></ul><p><strong>Installation</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The adversary downloads and installs more malicious software on the target system to maintain access to the target network for an extended period. They may use the weapon to install a backdoor to gain remote access. After the injection of the malicious code on one target system, the adversary gains the capability to spread the infection to other end systems in the network. Also, the adversary tries to hide the presence of malicious activities from security controls like firewalls using various techniques such as encryption.</p><p>The following are the activities of the adversary:</p><ul><li>Downloading and installing malicious software such as backdoors</li><li>Gaining remote access to the target system</li><li>Leveraging various methods to keep backdoor hidden and running</li><li>Maintaining access to the target system</li></ul><p><strong>Command and Control</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The adversary creates a command and control channel, which establishes two-way communication between the victim’s system and adversary-controlled server to communicate and pass data back and forth. The adversaries implement techniques such as encryption to hide the presence of such channels. Using this channel, the adversary performs remote exploitation on the target system or network.</p><p>The following are the activities of the adversary:</p><ul><li>Establishing a two-way communication channel between the victim’s system and the adversary-controlled server</li><li>Leveraging channels such as web traffic, email communication, and DNS messages</li><li>Applying privilege escalation techniques</li><li>Hiding any evidence of compromise using techniques such as encryption</li></ul><p><strong>Actions on Objectives</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The adversary controls the victim’s system from a remote location and finally accomplishes their intended goals. The adversary gains access to confidential data, disrupts the services or network, or destroys the operational capability of the target by gaining access to its network and compromising more systems. Also, the adversary may use this as a launching point to perform other attacks.</p></div>
