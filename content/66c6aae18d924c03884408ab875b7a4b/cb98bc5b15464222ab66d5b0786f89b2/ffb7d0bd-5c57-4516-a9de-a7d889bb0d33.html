  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">For obvious reasons, such as avoiding legal trouble and maintaining access, attackers will usually attempt to erase all evidence of their actions. Clearing tracks refers to the activities carried out by an attacker to hide malicious acts. The attacker’s intentions include continuing access to the victim’s system, remaining unnoticed and uncaught, and deleting evidence that might lead to their own prosecution. They use utilities such as PsTools (<em>https://docs.microsoft.com</em>), Netcat, or Trojans to erase their footprints from the system’s log files. Once the Trojans are in place, the attacker has most likely gained total control of the system and can execute scripts in the Trojan or rootkit to replace the critical system and log files to hide their presence in the system. Attackers always cover their tracks to hide their identity.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Other techniques include steganography and tunneling. Steganography is the process of hiding data in other data, for instance, in image and sound files. Tunneling takes advantage of the transmission protocol by carrying one protocol over another. Attackers can use even a small amount of extra space in the data packet’s TCP and IP headers to hide information. An attacker can use the compromised system to launch new attacks against other systems or as a means of reaching another system on the network undetected. Thus, this phase of the attack can turn into another attack’s reconnaissance phase. System administrators can deploy host-based IDS (intrusion detection systems) and antivirus software in order to detect Trojans and other seemingly compromised files and directories. A security professional must be aware of the tools and techniques that attackers deploy so that they can advocate and implement the countermeasures detailed in subsequent modules.</p></div>
