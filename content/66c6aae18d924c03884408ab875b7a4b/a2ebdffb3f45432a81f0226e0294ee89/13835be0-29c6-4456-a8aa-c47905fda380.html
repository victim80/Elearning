The screenshot shows the result analysis of a Whois lookup obtained with the two above-mentioned Whois services. The services perform Whois lookup by entering the target's domain or IP address. The domaintools.com service provides Whois information such as registrant information, email, administrative contact information, creation and expiry date, and a list of domain servers. SmartWhois, available at <em>http://www.tamos.com</em>, gives information about an IP address, hostname, or domain, including information about the country, state or province, city, phone number, fax number, name of the network provider, administrator, and technical support contact information. It also helps in finding the owner of the domain, the owner's contact information, the owner of the IP address block, registered date of the domain, and so on. It supports Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs), which means one can query domain names that use non-English characters. It also supports IPv6 addresses.</p></div></div>
