  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">This is the phase in which real hacking occurs. Attackers use vulnerabilities identified during the reconnaissance and scanning phases to gain access to the target system and network. Gaining access refers to the point where the attacker obtains access to the operating system or to applications on the computer or network. The attacker can gain access to the operating system, application, or network level. Even though attackers can cause plenty of damage without gaining any access to the system, the impact of unauthorized access is catastrophic. For instance, external denial-of-service attacks can either exhaust resources or stop services from running on the target system. Ending processes can stop a service, using a logic bomb or time bomb, or even reconfigure and crash the system. Furthermore, attackers can exhaust system and network resources by consuming all outgoing communication links.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers gain access to the target system locally (offline), over a LAN, or the Internet. Examples include password cracking, stack-based buffer overflows, denial-of-service, and session hijacking. Using a technique called spoofing to exploit the system by pretending to be a legitimate user or different system, attackers can send a data packet containing a bug to the target system in order to exploit a vulnerability. Packet flooding also breaks the availability of essential services. Smurf attacks attempt to cause users on a network to flood each other with data, making it appear as if everyone is attacking each other, and leaving the hacker anonymous.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A hackerâ€™s chances of gaining access to a target system depend on several factors such as the architecture and configuration of the target system, the skill level of the perpetrator, and the initial level of access obtained. Once an attacker gains access to the target system, they then try to escalate privileges in order to take complete control. In the process, they also compromise the intermediate systems that are connected to it.</p></div>
