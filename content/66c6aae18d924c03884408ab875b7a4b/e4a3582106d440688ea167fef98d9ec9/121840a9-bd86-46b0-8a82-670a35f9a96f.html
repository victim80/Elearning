  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Ethical hacking is the practice of employing computer and network skills in order to assist organizations in testing their network security for possible loopholes and vulnerabilities. White Hats (also known as security analysts or ethical hackers) are the individuals or experts who perform ethical hacking. Nowadays, most organizations (such as private companies, universities, and government organizations) are hiring White Hats to assist them in enhancing their cybersecurity. They perform hacking in ethical ways, with the permission of the network or system owner and without the intention to cause harm. Ethical hackers report all vulnerabilities to the system and network owner for remediation, thereby increasing the security of an organization’s information system. Ethical hacking involves the use of hacking tools, tricks, and techniques typically used by an attacker to verify the existence of exploitable vulnerabilities in system security.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Today, the term hacking is closely associated with illegal and unethical activities. There is continuing debate as to whether hacking can be ethical or not, given the fact that unauthorized access to any system is a crime. Consider the following definitions:</p><ul><li>The noun “hacker” refers to a person who enjoys learning the details of computer systems and stretching their capabilities.</li><li>The verb “to hack” describes the rapid development of new programs or the reverse engineering of existing software to make it better or more efficient in new and innovative ways.</li><li>The terms “cracker” and “attacker” refer to persons who employ their hacking skills for offensive purposes.</li><li>The term “ethical hacker” refers to security professionals who employ their hacking skills for defensive purposes.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">Most companies employ IT professionals to audit their systems for known vulnerabilities. Although this is a beneficial practice, crackers are usually more interested in using newer, lesser-known vulnerabilities, and so these by-the-numbers system audits do not suffice. A company needs someone who can think like a cracker, keep up with the newest vulnerabilities and exploits, and recognize potential vulnerabilities where others cannot. This is the role of the ethical hacker.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Ethical hackers usually employ the same tools and techniques as hackers, with the important exception that they do not damage the system. They evaluate system security, update the administrators regarding any discovered vulnerabilities, and recommend procedures for patching those vulnerabilities.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The important distinction between ethical hackers and crackers is consent. Crackers attempt to gain unauthorized access to systems, while ethical hackers are always completely open and transparent about what they are doing and how they are doing it. Ethical hacking is, therefore, always legal.</p></div>
