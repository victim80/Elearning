  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Maintaining access refers to the phase when the attacker tries to retain his or her ownership of the system. Once an attacker gains access to the target system with admin or root-level privileges (thus owning the system), they can use both the system and its resources at will. The attacker can either use the system as a launchpad to scan and exploit other systems or to keep a low profile and continue their exploitation. Both of these actions can cause a great amount of damage. For instance, the hacker could implement a sniffer to capture all network traffic, including Telnet and FTP (file transfer protocol) sessions with other systems, and then transmit that data wherever they please.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers who choose to remain undetected remove evidence of their entry and install a backdoor or a Trojan to gain repeat access. They can also install rootkits at the kernel level to gain full administrative access to the target computer. Rootkits gain access at the operating system level, while Trojans gain access at the application level. Both rootkits and Trojans require users to install them locally. In Windows systems, most Trojans install themselves as a service and run as part of the local system with administrative access.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers can upload, download, or manipulate data, applications, and configurations on the owned system and can also use Trojans to transfer usernames, passwords, and any other information stored on the system. They can maintain control over the system for a long time by closing up vulnerabilities to prevent other hackers from taking control of them, and sometimes, in the process, render some degree of protection to the system from other attacks. Attackers use the compromised system to launch further attacks.</p></div>
