  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">The terms “tactics, techniques, and procedures” refer to the patterns of activities and methods associated with specific threat actors or groups of threat actors. TTPs are helpful in analyzing threats and profiling threat actors and can further be used to strengthen the security infrastructure of an organization. The word “tactics” is defined as a guideline that describes the way an attacker performs their attack from beginning to end. The word “techniques” is defined as the technical methods used by an attacker to achieve intermediate results during their attack. Finally, the word “procedures” is defined as the organizational approach followed by the threat actors to launch their attack. In order to understand and defend against the threat actors, it is important to understand the TTPs used by adversaries. Understanding the tactics of an attacker helps to predict and detect evolving threats in the early stages. Understanding the techniques used by attackers helps to identify vulnerabilities and implement defensive measures in advance. Lastly, analyzing the procedures used by the attackers helps to identify what the attacker is looking for within the target organization’s infrastructure.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Organizations should understand TTPs to protect their network against threat actors and upcoming attacks. TTPs enable the organizations to stop attacks at the initial stage, thereby protecting the network against massive damages.</p><p><strong>Tactics</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Tactics describe the way the threat actor operates during different phases of an attack. It consists of the various tactics used to gather information for the initial exploitation, perform privilege escalation and lateral movement, and deploy measures for persistence access to the system. Generally, APT groups depend on a certain set of unchanging tactics, but in some cases, they adapt to different circumstances and alter the way they perform their attacks. Therefore, the difficulty of detecting and attributing the attack campaign depends on the tactics used to perform the attack.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For example, to obtain information, some threat actors depend solely on information available on the Internet, whereas others might perform social engineering or use connections in intermediate organizations. Once information such as the email addresses of employees of the target organization is gathered, the threat actors either choose to approach the target one by one or as a group. Furthermore, the attackers’ designed payload can stay constant from the beginning to the end of the attack or may be changed based on the targeted individual. Therefore, to understand the threat actors better, tactics used in the early stages of an attack must be analyzed properly.</p><p><strong>Techniques</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">To launch an attack successfully, threat actors use several techniques during its execution. These techniques include initial exploitation, setting up and maintaining command and control channels, accessing the target infrastructure, and covering the tracks of data exfiltration. The techniques followed by the threat actor to conduct an attack might vary, but they are mostly similar and can be used for profiling. Therefore, understanding the techniques used in the different phases of an attack is essential to analyzing the threat groups effectively.</p><p><strong>Procedures</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">“Procedures” involve a sequence of actions performed by the threat actors to execute different steps of an attack life cycle. The number of actions usually differs depending upon the objectives of the procedure and the APT group. An advanced threat actor uses advanced procedures that consist of more actions than a normal procedure to achieve the same intermediate result. This is done mainly to increase the success rate of an attack and decrease the probability of detection by security mechanisms.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">An understanding and proper analysis of the procedures followed by certain threat actors during an attack helps organizations profile threat actors. In the initial stage of an attack, such as during information gathering, observing the procedure of an APT group is difficult. However, the later stages of an attack can leave trails that may be used to understand the procedures the attacker followed.</p></div>
