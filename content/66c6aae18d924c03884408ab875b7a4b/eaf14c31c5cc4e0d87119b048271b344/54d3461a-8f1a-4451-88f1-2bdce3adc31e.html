  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Hackers usually fall into one of the following categories, according to their activities:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Black Hats</strong>: Black hats are individuals who use their extraordinary computing skills for illegal or malicious purposes. This category of hacker is often involved in criminal activities. They are also known as crackers.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>White Hats</strong>: White hats or penetration testers are individuals who use their hacking skills for defensive purposes. These days, almost every organization has security analysts who are knowledgeable about hacking countermeasures, which can secure its network and information systems against malicious attacks. They have permission from the system owner.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Gray Hats</strong>: Gray hats are the individuals who work both offensively and defensively at various times. Gray hats might help hackers to find various vulnerabilities in a system or network and, at the same time, help vendors to improve products (software or hardware) by checking limitations and making them more secure.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Suicide Hackers</strong>: Suicide hackers are individuals who aim to bring down critical infrastructure for a “cause” and are not worried about facing jail terms or any other kind of punishment. Suicide hackers are similar to suicide bombers who sacrifice their life for an attack and are thus not concerned with the consequences of their actions.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Script Kiddies</strong>: Script kiddies are unskilled hackers who compromise systems by running scripts, tools, and software developed by real hackers. They usually focus on the quantity, rather than the quality, of the attacks that they initiate. They do not have a specific target or goal in performing the attack and simply aim to gain popularity or prove their technical skills.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cyber Terrorists</strong>: Cyber terrorists are individuals with a wide range of skills who are motivated by religious or political beliefs to create the fear of large-scale disruption of computer networks.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>State-Sponsored Hackers</strong>: State-sponsored hackers are skilled individuals having expertise in hacking and are employed by the government to penetrate, gain top-secret information from, and damage the information systems of other government or military organizations. The main aim of these threat actors is to detect vulnerabilities in and exploit a nation’s infrastructure and gather intelligence or sensitive information.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hacktivist</strong>: Hacktivism is a form of activism in which hackers break into government or corporate computer systems as an act of protest. Hacktivists use hacking to increase awareness of their social or political agendas, as well as to boost their own reputations in both online and offline arenas. They promote a political agenda especially by using hacking to deface or disable websites. In some incidents, hacktivists may also obtain and reveal confidential information to the public. Common hacktivist targets include government agencies, financial institutions, multinational corporations, and any other entity that they perceive as a threat. Irrespective of hacktivists’ intentions, the gaining of unauthorized access is a crime.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hacker Teams:&nbsp;</strong>A hacker team is a consortium of skilled hackers having their own resources and funding. They work together in synergy for researching state-of-the-art technologies. These threat actors can also detect vulnerabilities, develop advanced tools, and execute attacks with proper planning.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Industrial Spies:&nbsp;</strong>Industrial spies are individuals who perform corporate espionage by illegally spying on competitor organizations. They focus on stealing critical information such as blueprints, formulas, product designs, and trade secrets. These threat actors use advanced persistent threats (APTs) to penetrate a network and can also stay undetected for years. In some cases, they may use social engineering techniques to steal sensitive information such as development plans and marketing strategies of the target company, which can result in financial loss to that company.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Insiders:&nbsp;</strong>An insider is any employee (trusted person) who has access to critical assets of an organization. An insider threat involves the use of privileged access to violate rules or intentionally cause harm to the organization’s information or information systems. Insiders can easily bypass security rules, corrupt valuable resources, and access sensitive information. Generally, insider threats arise from disgruntled employees, terminated employees, and undertrained staff members.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Criminal Syndicates:&nbsp;</strong>Criminal syndicates are groups of individuals or communities that are involved in organized, planned, and prolonged criminal activities. They exploit victims from distinct jurisdictions on the Internet, making them difficult to locate. The main aim of these threat actors is to illegally embezzle money by performing sophisticated cyber-attacks and money-laundering activities.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Organized Hackers:&nbsp;</strong>Organized hackers are a group of hackers working together in criminal activities. Such groups are well organized in a hierarchical structure consisting of leaders and workers. The group can also have multiple layers of management. These hackers are miscreants or hardened criminals who do not use their own devices; rather, they use rented devices or botnets and crimeware services to perform various cyber-attacks to pilfer money from victims and sell their information to the highest bidder. They can also swindle intellectual property, trade secrets, and marketing plans; covertly penetrate the target network; and remain undetected for long periods.</li></ul></div>
