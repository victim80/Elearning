  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Reconnaissance refers to the preparatory phase in which an attacker gathers as much information as possible about the target prior to launching the attack. In this phase, the attacker draws on competitive intelligence to learn more about the target. It could be the future point of return, noted for ease of entry for an attack when more about the target is known on a broad scale. The reconnaissance target range may include the target organization’s clients, employees, operations, network, and systems.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">This phase allows attackers to plan the attack. It may take some time as the attacker gathers as much information as possible. Part of this reconnaissance may involve social engineering. A social engineer is a person who convinces people to reveal information such as unlisted phone numbers, passwords, and other sensitive information. For instance, the hacker could call the target’s Internet service provider and, using personal information previously obtained, convince the customer service representative that the hacker is actually the target, and in doing so, obtain even more information about the target.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Another reconnaissance technique is dumpster diving. Dumpster diving is, simply enough, looking through an organization’s trash for any discarded sensitive information. Attackers can use the Internet to obtain information such as employees’ contact information, business partners, technologies currently in use, and other critical business knowledge. Dumpster diving may even provide attackers with even more sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, credit card statements, bank statements, ATM receipts, Social Security numbers, private telephone numbers, checking account numbers, or other sensitive data.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Searching for the target company’s web site in the Internet’s Whois database can easily provide hackers with the company’s IP addresses, domain names, and contact information.</p><p><strong>Reconnaissance Types</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Reconnaissance techniques are broadly categorized into active and passive.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">When an attacker is using passive reconnaissance techniques, they do not interact with the target directly. Instead, the attacker relies on publicly available information, news releases, or other no-contact methods.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Active reconnaissance techniques, on the other hand, involve direct interactions with the target system by using tools to detect open ports, accessible hosts, router locations, network mapping, details of operating systems, and applications. Attackers use active reconnaissance when there is a low probability of the detection of these activities. For example, they may make telephone calls to the help desk or technical department.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">As a security professional, it is important to be able to distinguish among the various reconnaissance methods and advocate preventive measures in the light of potential threats. Companies, on their part, must address security as an integral part of their business and operational strategies, and be equipped with the proper policies and procedures to check for potential vulnerabilities.</p></div>
