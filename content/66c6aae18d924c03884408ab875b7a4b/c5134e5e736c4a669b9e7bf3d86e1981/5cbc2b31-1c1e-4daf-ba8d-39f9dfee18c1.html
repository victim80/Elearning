  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Cyber threats are continuously evolving with the newer TTPs adapted based on the vulnerabilities of the target organization. Security professionals must perform continuous monitoring of IoCs to effectively and efficiently detect and respond to evolving cyber threats. Indicators of Compromise are the clues, artifacts, and pieces of forensic data that are found on a network or operating system of an organization that indicate a potential intrusion or malicious activity in the organization’s infrastructure.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">However, IoCs are not intelligence; rather, IoCs act as a good source of information about threats that serve as data points in the intelligence process. Actionable threat intelligence extracted from IoCs helps organizations enhance incident-handling strategies. Cybersecurity professionals use various automated tools to monitor IoCs to detect and prevent various security breaches to the organization. Monitoring IoCs also helps security teams enhance the security controls and policies of the organization to detect and block suspicious traffic to thwart further attacks. To overcome the threats associated with IoCs, some organizations like STIX and TAXII have developed standardized reports that contain condensed data related to attacks and shared it with others to leverage the incident response.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">An IoC is an atomic indicator, computed indicator, or behavioral indicator. It is the information regarding suspicious or malicious activities that is collected from various security establishments in a network’s infrastructure. Atomic indicators are those that cannot be segmented into smaller parts, and whose meaning is not changed in the context of an intrusion. Examples of atomic indicators are IP addresses and email addresses. Computed indicators are obtained from the data extracted from a security incident. Examples of computed indicators are hash values and regular expressions. Behavioral indicators refer to a grouping of both atomic and computed indicators, combined on the basis of some logic.</p></div>
