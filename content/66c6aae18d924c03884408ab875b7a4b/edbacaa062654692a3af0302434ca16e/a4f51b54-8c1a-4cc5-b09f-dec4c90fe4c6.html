Here, the attacker uses the details gathered during reconnaissance to scan the network for specific information. Scanning is a logical extension of active reconnaissance, and in fact, some experts do not differentiate scanning from active reconnaissance. There is a slight difference, however, in that scanning involves more in-depth probing on the part of the attacker. Often the reconnaissance and scanning phases overlap, and it is not always possible to separate the two. An attacker can gather critical network information such as the mapping of systems, routers, and firewalls by using simple tools such as the standard Windows utility Traceroute.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Scanning can include the use of dialers, port scanners, network mappers, ping tools, vulnerability scanners, or other tools. Attackers extract information such as live machines, port, port status, OS details, device type, and system uptime to launch an attack.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Port scanners detect listening ports to find information about the nature of services running on the target machine. The primary defense technique against port scanners is shutting down services that are not required and implementing appropriate port filtering. However, attackers can still use tools to determine the rules implemented by the port filtering.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The most commonly used tools are vulnerability scanners, which can search for thousands of known vulnerabilities on a target network. This gives the attacker an advantage because he or she only has to find a single means of entry, while the systems professional has to secure as much vulnerability as possible by applying patches. Organizations that use intrusion detection systems still have to remain vigilant because attackers can and will use evasion techniques wherever possible.</p></div>
