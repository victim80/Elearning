  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Most organizations spend significant amounts of time defining and implementing Wi-Fi security policies, but it may be possible for a client of a wireless network to change the security settings of an AP unintentionally. This, in turn, may lead to misconfigurations in APs. A misconfigured AP can expose an otherwise well-secured network to attacks.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">It is difficult to detect a misconfigured AP because it is an authorized, legitimate device on the network. Attackers can easily connect to a secured network through misconfigured APs, which continue to function normally after an attacker connects because no alerts will be triggered even if the attacker uses the connection to compromise security. Many organizations fail to maintain Wi-Fi security policies and do not take proper measures to eliminate this flaw in security configurations.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">As the Wi-Fi networks of organizations expand to more locations and more devices, misconfigured APs become increasingly dangerous. The key elements that play an important role in this kind of attack include the following:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SSID broadcast:&nbsp;</strong>An attacker configures APs to broadcast SSIDs to authorized users. All AP models have their own default SSID, and APs with default configurations using default SSIDs are vulnerable to brute-force dictionary attacks. Even if users enable WEP, an unencrypted SSID broadcasts the password in plaintext.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Weak password:&nbsp;</strong>Some network administrators incorrectly use SSIDs as basic passwords to verify authorized users. SSIDs act as rudimentary passwords and help network administrators recognize authorized wireless devices in the network.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Configuration error:</strong> Configuration errors include errors made during installation, configuration policies on an AP, human errors made while troubleshooting WLAN problems, and security changes not implemented uniformly across an architecture. SSID broadcasting is a configuration error that assists attackers in stealing an SSID, which makes the AP assume that the attacker is attempting a legitimate connection.</li></ul></div>
