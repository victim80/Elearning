  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Bluetooth hacking refers to the exploitation of Bluetooth stack implementation vulnerabilities to compromise sensitive data in Bluetooth-enabled devices and networks. Bluetooth-enabled devices connect and communicate wirelessly through ad-hoc networks known as piconets. Attackers can gain information by hacking the target Bluetooth-enabled device from another Bluetooth-enabled device.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are some Bluetooth device attacks:</p><ul><li class="Default" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Bluesmacking:</strong> A Bluesmacking attack occurs when an attacker sends an oversized ping packet to a victim's device, causing a buffer overflow. This type of attack is similar to an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) ping-of-death attack.</li><li class="Default" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Bluejacking:</strong> Bluejacking is the use of Bluetooth to send messages to users without the recipient's consent, similar to email spamming. Prior to any Bluetooth communication, the device initiating the connection must provide a name that is displayed on the recipient's screen. As this name is user-defined, it can be set to be an annoying message or advertisement. Strictly speaking, Bluejacking does not cause any damage to the receiving device. However, it may be irritating and disruptive to the victims.</li><li class="Default" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Bluesnarfing:</strong> Bluesnarfing is a method of gaining access to sensitive data in a Bluetooth-enabled device. An attacker within the range of a target can use specialized software to obtain the data stored on the victim’s device. To perform Bluesnarfing, an attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Object Exchange (OBEX) protocol that Bluetooth uses to exchange information. The attacker connects with the target and performs a GET operation for files with correctly guessed or known names, such as /pb.vcf for the device’s phonebook or telecom /cal.vcs for the device’s calendar file.</li><li class="Default" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>BlueSniff:</strong> BlueSniff is a proof-of-concept code for a Bluetooth wardriving utility. It is useful for finding hidden and discoverable Bluetooth devices. It operates on Linux.</li><li class="Default" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Bluebugging:</strong> Bluebugging is an attack in which an attacker gains remote access to a target Bluetooth-enabled device without the victim’s awareness. In this attack, an attacker sniffs sensitive information and might perform malicious activities such as intercepting phone calls and messages and forwarding calls and text messages.</li><li class="Default" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>BluePrinting:&nbsp;</strong>BluePrinting is a footprinting technique performed by an attacker to determine the make and model of a target Bluetooth-enabled device. Attackers collect this information to create infographics of the model, manufacturer, etc. and analyze them to determine whether the device has exploitable vulnerabilities.</li><li class="Default" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Btlejacking:</strong> A Btlejacking attack is detrimental to Bluetooth low energy (BLE) devices. The attacker can sniff, jam, and take control of the data transmission between BLE devices by performing an MITM attack. Following a successful attempt, the attacker can also bypass security mechanisms and listen to the information being shared. To implement this attack, the attacker must use affordable firmware-embedded equipment and minor software coding.</li><li class="Default" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>KNOB attack:&nbsp;</strong>A Key Negotiation of Bluetooth (KNOB) attack enables an attacker to breach Bluetooth security mechanisms and perform an MITM attack on paired devices without being traced. The attacker leverages a vulnerability in the Bluetooth wireless standard and eavesdrops on all the data being shared in the network, such as keystrokes, chats, and documents. A KNOB attack is especially detrimental to two Bluetooth-enabled devices sharing encrypted keys. The attack is launched on short-distance communication protocols of Bluetooth negotiating the encryption keys required to be shared between nodes to establish a connection.</li><li class="Default" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>MAC spoofing attack:</strong> A MAC spoofing attack is a passive attack in which attackers spoof the MAC address of a target Bluetooth-enabled device to intercept or manipulate the data sent to the target device.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Man-in-the-Middle/impersonation attack:</strong> In an MITM/impersonation attack, attackers manipulate the data transmitted between devices communicating via a Bluetooth connection (piconet). During this attack, the devices intended to pair with each other unknowingly pair with the attacker’s device, thereby allowing the attacker to intercept and manipulate the data transmitted in the piconet.</li></ul></div>
