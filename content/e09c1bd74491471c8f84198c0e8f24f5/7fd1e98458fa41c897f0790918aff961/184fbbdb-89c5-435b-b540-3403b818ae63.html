  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p>Network technology is heading toward a new era of technological evolution through wireless technologies. Wireless networking is revolutionizing the way people work and play. By removing physical connections or cables, individuals can use networks in new ways to make data portable, mobile, and accessible. A wireless network is an unbounded data communication system that uses radio-frequency technology to communicate with devices and obtain data. This network frees the user from complicated and multiple wired connections using electromagnetic (EM) waves to interconnect two individual points without establishing any physical connection. This section will describe basic wireless concepts.</p></div>
