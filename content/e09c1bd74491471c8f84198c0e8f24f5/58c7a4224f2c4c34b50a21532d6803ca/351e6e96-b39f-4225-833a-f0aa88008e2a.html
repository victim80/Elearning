An attacker can easily compromise a wireless network without proper security measures or an appropriate network configuration. Because high-security mechanisms for wireless networks may be expensive, it is advisable to determine critical sources, risks, or vulnerabilities associated with the network and then check whether the current security mechanism can protect the wireless network against all possible attacks. If not, the security mechanisms must be upgraded.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">This module describes the types of wireless networks and wireless network standards. Various wireless encryption algorithms are analyzed, along with their strengths and weaknesses. The module also discusses various wireless-network attack techniques and countermeasures to protect wireless networks.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">At the end of this module, you will be able to do the following:</p><ul><li>Describe wireless terminology</li><li>Explain different wireless encryption algorithms</li><li>Describe wireless network-specific attack techniques</li><li>Use different wireless attack tools</li><li>Describe Bluetooth attack techniques</li><li>Apply wireless attack countermeasures</li><li>Use different wireless security tools</li></ul></div>
