  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Jamming is an attack performed on a wireless network to compromise it. In this type of exploitation, overwhelming volumes of malicious traffic result in a DoS to authorized users, obstructing legitimate traffic. All wireless networks are prone to jamming, and spectrum jamming attacks usually block all communications completely.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">An attacker uses specialized hardware to perform this kind of attack. The signals generated by jamming devices appear to be noise to the devices on the wireless network, which causes them to hold their transmissions until the signal has subsided, resulting in a DoS. Furthermore, jamming signal attacks are not easily noticeable. The procedure of a jamming signal attack is summarized as follows.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">An attacker stakes out the target area from a nearby location with a high-gain amplifier that drowns out a legitimate AP.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Users are unable get through to log in or are disconnected by the overpowering nearby signal.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The jamming signal causes a DoS because 802.11 is a CSMA/CA protocol, the collision-avoidance algorithms of which require a period of silence before a radio is allowed to transmit.</li></ul></div>
