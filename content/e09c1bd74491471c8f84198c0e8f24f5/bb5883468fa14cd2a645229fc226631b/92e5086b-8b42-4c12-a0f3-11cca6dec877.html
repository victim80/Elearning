  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">In wireless networks, the transmit probes of APs respond through beacons to advertise presence and availability. The probe responses contain information on the AP identity (MAC address) and the identity of the network it supports (SSID). Clients in the vicinity connect to the network through these beacons based on the MAC address and the SSID it contains. Many software tools and APs allow setting user-defined values for the MAC addresses and SSIDs of AP devices. An attacker can spoof the MAC address of the AP by programming a rogue AP to advertise the same identity information as that of the legitimate AP. An attacker connected to the AP as an authorized client can have full access to the network. This type of attack succeeds when the target wireless network uses MAC filtering to authenticate clients (users).</p></div>
