  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Mis-association is a security flaw that can occur when a network client connects with a neighboring AP. Client mis-associations can occur for various reasons such as misconfigured clients, insufficient coverage of corporate Wi-Fi, lack of a Wi-Fi policy, restrictions on the use of Internet in the office, ad-hoc connections that administrators do not manage regularly, and attractive SSIDs. They can occur with or without the knowledge of the wireless client and rogue AP.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To perform a client mis-association attack, an attacker sets up a rogue AP outside the corporationâ€™s perimeter. The attacker first learns the SSID of the target wireless network. Using a spoofed SSID, the attacker may send beacons advertising the rogue AP in order to lure clients to connect. The attacker can use the rogue AP as a channel to bypass enterprise security policies. Once a client connects to the rogue AP, an attacker can retrieve sensitive information such as usernames and passwords by launching MITM, EAP dictionary, or Metasploit attacks to exploit client mis-association.</p></div>
