With the global wireless communication revolution, data networking and telecommunication are fundamentally changing. Wi-Fi refers to a WLAN based on the IEEE 802.11 standard, and it allows a device to access the network from anywhere within the range of an AP. Wi-Fi is a widely used technology in wireless communication across a radio channel. Wi-Fi utilizes numerous techniques such as DSSS, FHSS, infrared (IR), and OFDM to establish a connection between a transmitter and receiver. Devices such as personal computers, video-game consoles, and smartphones use Wi-Fi to connect to a network resource such as the Internet via a wireless network AP.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are some of the advantages and disadvantages of wireless networks:</p><p><strong>Advantages</strong></p><ul><li>Installation is fast and easy without the need for wiring through walls and ceilings</li><li>Easily provides connectivity in areas where it is difficult to lay cables</li><li>The network can be accessed from anywhere within the range of an AP</li><li>Public spaces such as airports, libraries, schools, and even coffee shops offer constant Internet connections through WLANs</li></ul><p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p><ul><li>Security may not meet expectations</li><li>The bandwidth suffers as the number of devices in the network increases</li><li>Wi-Fi upgrades may require new wireless cards and/or APs</li><li>Some electronic equipment can interfere with Wi-Fi networks</li></ul></div>
