If a device attempts to connect to another, the device attempting to establish the connection must search for a device that is in the discoverable mode; otherwise, the device attempting to initiate the connection will not be able to detect the other device. The discoverable mode is necessary only while connecting to a device for the first time. Upon saving the connection, the devices remember each other; therefore, the discoverable mode is not necessary for lateral connection establishment.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Limited discoverable:&nbsp;</strong>In the limited discoverable mode, the Bluetooth devices are discoverable only for a limited period, for a specific event, or during temporary conditions. However, there is no Host Controller interface (HCI) command to set a device directly in the limited discoverable mode. A user has to do this indirectly. When a device is set to the limited discoverable mode, it filters out non-matched IACs and reveals itself only to those that matched.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Non-discoverable:</strong> Setting a Bluetooth device to the non-discoverable mode prevents that device from appearing on the list during a Bluetooth-enabled device search process. However, it remains visible to users and devices that were previously paired with it or know its MAC address.</li></ul><p class="Default" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Pairing Modes</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are the pairing modes for Bluetooth devices.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Non-pairable mode</strong>: In the non-pairable mode, a Bluetooth device rejects pairing requests sent by any device.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pairable mode</strong>: In the pairable mode, a Bluetooth device can accept pairing requests and establish a connection with a device that requested pairing.</li></ul></div>
