  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Unauthorized association is a major threat to wireless networks. It has two forms: accidental association and malicious association. An attacker performs malicious association with the help of soft APs instead of corporate APs. The attacker creates a soft AP, typically on a laptop, by running a tool that makes the laptop’s NIC appear as a legitimate AP. The attacker then uses the soft AP to gain access to the target wireless network. Software APs are available on client cards or embedded WLAN radios in some PDAs and laptops; an attacker can launch these directly or through a virus program. The attacker infects the victim's machine and activates soft APs, allowing an unauthorized connection to the enterprise network. An attacker who gains access to the network using unauthorized association may steal passwords, launch attacks on a wired network, or plant Trojans. On the other hand, accidental association involves connecting to the target network’s AP from a neighboring organization’s overlapping network without the victim’s knowledge.</p></div>
