  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">If multiple WLANs co-exist in the same area, a user can connect to any available network. Such areas are vulnerable to attacks. Normally, when a wireless client is switched on, it probes a nearby wireless network for a specific SSID. An attacker takes advantage of this behavior of wireless clients by setting up an unauthorized wireless network using a rogue AP. This AP has high-power (high-gain) antennas and uses the same SSID as the target network. Users who regularly connect to multiple WLANs may connect to the rogue AP. Such APs mounted by attackers are called “honeypot” APs. They transmit a stronger beacon signal than legitimate APs so that NICs searching for the strongest available signal may connect to the rogue AP. If an authorized user connects to a honeypot AP, a security vulnerability is created and sensitive user information such as identity, username, and password may be revealed to the attacker.</p></div>
