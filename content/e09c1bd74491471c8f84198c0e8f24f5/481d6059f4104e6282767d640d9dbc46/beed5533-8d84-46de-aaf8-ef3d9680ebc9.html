  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p class="BodyText4" style="text-align: justify;">APs connect to client NICs by authenticating with the help of SSIDs. Unauthorized (or rogue) APs can allow anyone with an 802.11-equipped device to connect to a corporate network. An unauthorized AP can give an attacker access to the network.</p><p class="BodyText4" style="text-align: justify;">With the help of wireless sniffing tools, the following can be determined from APs: authorized MAC addresses, the vendor name, and security configurations. An attacker can then create a list of MAC addresses of authorized APs on the target LAN and crosscheck this list with the list of MAC addresses found by sniffing. Subsequently, an attacker can create a rogue AP and place it near the target corporate network. Attackers use rogue APs placed in an 802.11 network to hijack the connections of legitimate network users. When a user turns on a computer, the rogue AP will offer to connect with the network userâ€™s NIC. The attacker lures the user to connect to the rogue AP by sending the SSID. If the user connects to the rogue AP under the impression that it is a legitimate AP, all the traffic from the user passes through the rogue AP, enabling a form of wireless packet sniffing. The sniffed packets may even contain usernames and passwords.</p></div>
