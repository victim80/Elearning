The FISMA provides a comprehensive framework for ensuring the effectiveness of information security controls over information resources that support federal operations and assets. It requires each federal agency to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide program to provide information security for the information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency, including those provided or managed by another agency, contractor, or another source. The FISMA framework includes:</p><ul><li>Standards for categorizing information and information systems by mission impact</li><li>Standards for the minimum security requirements for information and information systems</li><li>Guidance for selecting appropriate security controls for information systems</li><li>Guidance for assessing security controls in information systems and determining their effectiveness</li><li>Guidance for the security authorization of information systems</li></ul></div>
