  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Information security relies on five major elements: confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity, and non-repudiation.</p><p><strong>Confidentiality</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Confidentiality is the assurance that the information is accessible only to authorized. Confidentiality breaches may occur due to improper data handling or a hacking attempt. Confidentiality controls include data classification, data encryption, and proper disposal of equipment (such as DVDs, USB drives, etc.).</p><p><strong>Integrity</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Integrity is the trustworthiness of data or resources in the prevention of improper and unauthorized changesâ€”the assurance that information is sufficiently accurate for its purpose. Measures to maintain data integrity may include a checksum (a number produced by a mathematical function to verify that a given block of data is not changed) and access control (which ensures that only authorized people can update, add, or delete data).</p><p><strong>Availability</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Availability is the assurance that the systems responsible for delivering, storing, and processing information are accessible when required by authorized users. Measures to maintain data availability can include disk arrays for redundant systems and clustered machines, antivirus software to combat malware, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) prevention systems.</p><p><strong>Authenticity</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Authenticity refers to the characteristic of communication, documents, or any data that ensures the quality of being genuine or uncorrupted. The major role of authentication is to confirm that a user is genuine. Controls such as biometrics, smart cards, and digital certificates ensure the authenticity of data, transactions, communications, and documents.</p><p><strong>Non-Repudiation</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Non-repudiation is a way to guarantee that the sender of a message cannot later deny having sent the message and that the recipient cannot deny having received the message. Individuals and organizations use digital signatures to ensure non-repudiation.</p></div>
