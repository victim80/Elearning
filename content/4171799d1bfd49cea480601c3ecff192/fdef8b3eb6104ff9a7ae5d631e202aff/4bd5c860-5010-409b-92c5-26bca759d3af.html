  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Today, organizations are increasingly relying on computing networks because users and employees expect to exchange information at the speed of thought. Additionally, with the evolution of technology, there has been a greater focus on ease of use. Routine tasks rely on the use of computers for accessing, providing, or just storing information. However, as information assets differentiate the competitive organization from others of its kind, do they register an increase in their contribution to the corporate capital? There is a sense of urgency on behalf of the organization to secure these assets from likely threats and vulnerabilities. The subject of addressing information security is vast and it is the endeavor of this course to provide the student with a comprehensive body of knowledge required to secure the information assets under his/her consideration.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">This course assumes that organizational policies exist that are endorsed by top-level management and that business objective and goals related to security have been incorporated into the corporate strategy. A security policy is a specification of how objects in a security domain are allowed to interact. The importance of security in the contemporary information and telecommunications scenario cannot be overemphasized. There are myriad reasons for securing ICT infrastructure. Initially, computers were designed to facilitate research, and this did not place much emphasis on security as these resources, being scarce, were meant for sharing. The permeation of computers into both the routine workspace and daily life has led to more control being transferred to computers and a higher dependency on them for facilitating important routine tasks. This has further increased the usage of networked environments and network-based applications. Any network disruptions mean a loss of time, money, and, sometimes, even loss of life. Additionally, the increasing complexity of computer infrastructure administration and management is creating a direct impact of security breaches on the corporate asset base and goodwill.</p></div>
