  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <em>https://gdpr.eu</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is one of the most stringent privacy and security laws globally. Though it was drafted and passed by the European Union (EU), it imposes obligations onto organizations anywhere, so long as they target or collect data related to people in the EU. The regulation was put into effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR will levy harsh fines against those who violate its privacy and security standards, with penalties reaching tens of millions of euros.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">With the GDPR, Europe signifies its firm stance on data privacy and security when more people are entrusting their data with cloud services, and breaches are a daily occurrence. The regulation itself is extensive, far-reaching, and relatively light on specifics, making GDPR compliance a daunting prospect, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>GDPR Data Protection Principles</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The GDPR includes seven protection and accountability principles outlined in Article 5.1-2:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency</strong>: Processing must be lawful, fair, and transparent to the data subject.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Purpose limitation:</strong> You must process data for the legitimate purposes specified explicitly to the data subject when you collected it.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Data minimization:</strong> You should collect and process only as much data as necessary for the purposes specified.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Accuracy:</strong> You must keep personal data accurate and up to date.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Storage limitation:</strong> You may only store personally identifying data for as long as necessary for the specified purpose.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Integrity and confidentiality:</strong> Processing must be done in such a way as to ensure appropriate security, integrity, and confidentiality (e.g., by using encryption).</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Accountability:</strong> The data controller is responsible for demonstrating GDPR compliance with all of these principles.</li></ul></div>
