  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><div class="WordSection1"><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers generally have motives (goals), and objectives behind their information security attacks. A motive originates out of the notion that a target system stores or processes something valuable, which leads to the threat of an attack on the system. The purpose of the attack may be to disrupt the target organization’s business operations, to steal valuable information for the sake of curiosity, or even to exact revenge. Therefore, these motives or goals depend on the attacker’s state of mind, their reason for carrying out such an activity, as well as their resources and capabilities. Once the attacker determines their goal, they can employ various tools, attack techniques, and methods to exploit vulnerabilities in a computer system or security policy and controls.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Attacks = Motive (Goal) + Method + Vulnerability</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Motives behind information security attacks</strong></p></div><ul><li>Disrupt business continuity</li><li>Perform information theft</li><li>Manipulating data</li><li>Create fear and chaos by disrupting critical infrastructures</li><li>Bring financial loss to the target</li><li>Propagate religious or political beliefs</li><li>Achieve a state’s military objectives</li><li>Damage the reputation of the target</li><li>Take revenge</li><li>Demand ransom</li></ul></div>
