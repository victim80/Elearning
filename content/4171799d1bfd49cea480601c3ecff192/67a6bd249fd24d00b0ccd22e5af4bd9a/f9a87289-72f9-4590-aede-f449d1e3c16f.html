  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Technology is evolving at an unprecedented rate. As a result, new products in the market focus more on ease of use than on secure computing. Though technology was originally developed for “honest” research and academic purposes, it has not evolved at the same pace as user proficiency. Moreover, in this evolution, system designers often overlook vulnerabilities during the intended deployment of the system. However, adding more built-in default security mechanisms allows users more competence. With the augmented use of computers for an increasing number of routine activities, it is becoming difficult for security professionals to allocate resources exclusively for securing systems. This includes the time needed to check log files, detect vulnerabilities, and apply security update patches.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Routine activities alone consume most of system professionals’ time, which leaves relatively little time for vigilant administration or for the deployment of security measures for computing resources on a regular and innovative basis. This fact has increased the demand for dedicated security professionals to constantly monitor and defend ICT (Information and Communication Technology) resources.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Originally, to “hack” meant to possess extraordinary computer skills to explore hidden features of computer systems. In the context of information security, hacking is defined as the exploitation of vulnerabilities of computer systems and networks and requires great proficiency. However, automated tools and codes are available today on the Internet that make it possible for anyone who possesses the will to succeed at hacking. However, mere compromise of system security does not denote hacking success. There are websites that insist on “taking back the Internet” as well as people who believe that they are doing everyone a favor by posting details of their exploits.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The ease with which system vulnerabilities can be exploited has increased while the knowledge curve required to perform such exploits has decreased. The concept of the elite “super attacker” is an illusion. One of the main impediments of the growth of security infrastructure lies in an unwillingness on the part of exploited or compromised victims to report such incidents for fear of losing the goodwill and faith of their employees, customers, or partners, and/or of losing market share. The trend of information assets influencing the market has seen more companies thinking twice before reporting incidents to law enforcement officials for the fear of “bad press” and negative publicity.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The increasingly networked environment, with companies often using their websites as single points of contact across geographical boundaries, makes it critical for security professionals to take countermeasures to prevent exploits that can result in data loss. This is why corporations need to invest in security measures to protect their information assets.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The level of security in any system can be defined by the strength of three components:</p><ul><li><strong>Functionality</strong>: The set of features provided by the system.</li><li><strong>Usability</strong>: The GUI components used to design the system for ease of use.</li><li><strong>Security</strong>: Restrictions imposed on accessing the components of the system.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">The relationship between these three components is demonstrated by using a triangle because an increase or decrease in any one of the components automatically affects the other two components. Moving the ball toward any of the three components means decreasing the intensity of the other two components.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The diagram represents the relationship between functionality, usability, and security. For example, as shown in the figure, if the ball moves toward security, it means increased security and decreased functionality and usability. If the ball is in the center of the triangle, then all the three components are balanced. If the ball moves toward usability, it leads to increased usability and decreased functionality as well as security. For any implementation of security controls, all the three components have to be considered carefully and balanced to get acceptable functionality and usability with acceptable security.</p></div>
