  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:center;">Figure 6.23: Schematic of a DoS attack</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>DoS attacks have various forms and target various services. The attacks may cause the following:</strong></p><ul><li>Consumption of resources</li><li>Consumption of bandwidth, disk space, CPU time, or data structures</li><li>Actual physical destruction or alteration of network components</li><li>Destruction of programming and files in a computer system</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">In general, DoS attacks target network bandwidth or connectivity. Bandwidth attacks overflow the network with a high volume of traffic by using existing network resources, thereby depriving legitimate users of these resources. Connectivity attacks overflow a system with a large number of connection requests, consuming all available OS resources to prevent the system from processing legitimate user requests.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Consider a food catering company that conducts much of its business over the phone. If an attacker wants to disrupt this business, they need to find a way to block the company’s phone lines, which would make it impossible for the company to do business. A DoS attack works along the same lines—the attacker uses up all the ways to connect to the victim’s system, making legitimate business impossible.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">DoS attacks are a kind of security breach that does not generally result in the theft of information. However, these attacks can harm the target in terms of time and resources. Furthermore, security failure might cause the loss of a service such as email. In the worst-case scenario, a DoS attack can cause the accidental destruction of the files and programs of millions of people who were connected to the victim’s system at the time of the attack.</p></div>
