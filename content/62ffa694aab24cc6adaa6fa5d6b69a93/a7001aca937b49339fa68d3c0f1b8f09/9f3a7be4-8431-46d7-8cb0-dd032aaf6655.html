  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">MAC flooding is a technique used to compromise the security of network switches that connect network segments or devices. Attackers use the MAC flooding technique to force a switch to act as a hub so that they can easily sniff the traffic.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In a switched network, an Ethernet switch contains a CAM table that stores all the MAC addresses of devices connected in the network. A switch acts as an intermediate device between one or more computers in a network. It looks for Ethernet frames, which carry the destination MAC address; then, it tallies this address with the MAC address in its CAM table and forwards the traffic to the destined machine. Unlike a hub, which broadcasts data across the network, a switch sends data only to the intended recipient. Thus, a switched network is more secure compared to a hub network. However, the size of the CAM table is fixed, and as it can store only a limited number of MAC addresses in it, an attacker may send numerous fake MAC address to the switch. No problem occurs until the MAC address table is full. Once the MAC address table is full, any further requests may force the switch to enter fail-open mode. In the fail-open mode, the switch starts behaving like a hub and broadcasts incoming traffic through all the ports in the network. The attacker then changes his/her machineâ€™s NIC to promiscuous mode to enable the machine to accept all the traffic entering it. Thus, attackers can sniff the traffic easily and steal sensitive information.</p></div>
