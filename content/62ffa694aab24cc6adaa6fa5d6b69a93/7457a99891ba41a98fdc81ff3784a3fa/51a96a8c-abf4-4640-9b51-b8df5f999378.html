  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Network administrators use ICMP primarily for IP operations, troubleshooting, and error messaging for undeliverable packets. In this attack, attackers send large volumes of ICMP echo request packets to a victim’s system directly or through reflection networks. These packets signal the victim’s system to reply, and the large traffic saturates the bandwidth of the victim’s network connection, causing it to be overwhelmed and subsequently stop responding to legitimate TCP/IP requests.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">To protect against ICMP flood attacks, it is necessary to set a threshold that invokes the ICMP flood attack protection feature when exceeded. When the ICMP threshold is exceeded (by default, the threshold value is 1000 packets/s), the router rejects further ICMP echo requests from all addresses in the same security zone for the remainder of the current second as well as the next second.</p></div>
