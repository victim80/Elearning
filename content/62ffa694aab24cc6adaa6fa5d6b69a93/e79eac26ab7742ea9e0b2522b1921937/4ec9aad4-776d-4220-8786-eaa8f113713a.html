It is designed to attack up to 256 target URLs simultaneously. It sends HTTP POST and GET requests to a computer that uses lulz-inspired GUIs. Its features are summarized as follows:</p><ul><li>High-speed multi-threaded HTTP flooding</li><li>Simultaneous flooding of up to 256 websites</li><li>Built-in scripting system to allow the deployment of “boosters,” which are scripts designed to thwart DDoS countermeasures and increase DoS output</li><li>Portability to Linux/Mac with a few bug fixes</li><li>Ability to select the number of threads in an ongoing attack</li><li>Ability to throttle attacks individually with three settings: LOW, MEDIUM, and HIGH</li></ul></div>
