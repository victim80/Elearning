  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Address resolution protocol (ARP) is a protocol used for mapping an IP address to a physical machine address that is recognized in the local network. ARP packets can be forged to send data to the attacker’s machine. ARP spoofing involves constructing a large number of forged ARP request and reply packets to overload a switch. When a machine sends an ARP request, it assumes that the ARP reply will come from the right machine. ARP provides no means of verifying the authenticity of the responding device. Even systems that have not made an ARP request can accept the ARP replies coming from other devices. Attackers use this flaw in ARP to create malformed ARP replies containing spoofed IP and MAC addresses. Assuming this to be the legitimate ARP reply, the victim’s computer blindly accepts the ARP entry into its ARP table. Once the ARP table is flooded with spoofed ARP replies, the switch is set to forwarding mode, and the attacker intercepts all the data that flows from the victim’s machine without the victim being aware of the attack. Attackers flood a target computer’s ARP cache with forged entries; this is also known as poisoning. ARP spoofing is an intermediary for performing attacks such as DoS, MITM, and session hijacking.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>How does ARP Spoofing Work?</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">ARP spoofing is a method of attacking an Ethernet LAN. When a legitimate user initiates a session with another user in the same layer 2 broadcast domain, the switch broadcasts an ARP request using the recipient's IP address, while the sender waits for the recipient to respond with a MAC address. An attacker eavesdropping on this unprotected layer 2 broadcast domain can respond to the broadcast ARP request and replies to the sender by spoofing the intended recipient’s IP address. The attacker runs a sniffer and turns the machine’s NIC adapter to promiscuous mode.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">ARP spoofing is a method of attacking an Ethernet LAN. It succeeds by changing the IP address of the attacker’s computer to that of the target computer. A forged ARP request and reply packet can find a place in the target ARP cache in this process. As the ARP reply has been forged, the destination computer (target) sends frames to the attacker’s computer, where the attacker can modify the frames before sending them to the source machine (User A) in an MITM attack. The attacker can also launch a DoS attack by associating a non-existent MAC address to the IP address of the gateway; alternatively, the attacker may sniff the traffic passively and then forward it to the target destination.</p></div>
