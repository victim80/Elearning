  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Permanent DoS (PDoS) attacks, also known as phlashing, purely target hardware and cause irreversible damage to the hardware. Unlike other types of DoS attacks, it sabotages the system hardware, requiring the victim to replace or reinstall the hardware. The PDoS attack exploits security flaws in a device to allow remote administration on the management interfaces of the victim’s hardware, such as printers, routers, and other networking devices.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">This type of attack is quicker and more destructive than conventional DoS attacks. It works with a limited amount of resources, unlike a DDoS attack, in which attackers unleash a set of zombies onto a target. Attackers perform PDoS attacks by using a method known as the “bricking” of a system. In this method, the attacker sends emails, IRC chats, tweets, or videos with fraudulent content for hardware updates to the victim. The hardware updates are modified and corrupted with vulnerabilities or defective firmware. When the victim clicks on a link or pop-up window referring to the fraudulent hardware update, the victim installs it in their system. Consequently, the attacker attains complete control over the victim’s system.</p></div>
