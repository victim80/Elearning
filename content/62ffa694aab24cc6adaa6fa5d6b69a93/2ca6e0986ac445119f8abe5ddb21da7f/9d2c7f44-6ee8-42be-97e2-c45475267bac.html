  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:center;">Figure 6.21: Sniffing detection using the DNS method</p><p><strong>ARP Method</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">This technique sends a non-broadcast ARP to all the nodes in the network. The node that runs in promiscuous mode on the network will cache the local ARP address. Then, it will broadcast a ping message on the network with the local IP address but a different MAC address. In this case, only the node that has the MAC address (cached earlier) will be able to respond to your broadcast ping request. A machine in promiscuous mode replies to the ping message, as it has the correct information about the host that is sending ping requests in its cache; the remaining machines will send an ARP probe to identify the source of the ping request. This will detect the node on which the sniffer is running.</p></div>
