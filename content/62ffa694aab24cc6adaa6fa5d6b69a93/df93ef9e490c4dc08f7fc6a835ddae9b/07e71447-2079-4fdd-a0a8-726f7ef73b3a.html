  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">In a Ping of Death (PoD) attack, an attacker attempts to crash, destabilize, or freeze the target system or service by sending malformed or oversized packets using a simple ping command. Suppose an attacker sends a packet with a size of 65,538 bytes to the target web server. This size exceeds the size limit prescribed by RFC 791 IP, which is 65,535 bytes. The reassembly process performed by the receiving system might cause the system to crash. In such attacks, the attackerâ€™s identity can be easily spoofed, and the attacker might not need detailed knowledge of the target machine, except its IP address.</p></div>
