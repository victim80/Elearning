  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">In a SYN attack, the attacker sends a large number of SYN requests to the target server (victim) with fake source IP addresses. The attack creates incomplete TCP connections that use up network resources. Normally, when a client wants to begin a TCP connection to a server, the client and server exchange the following series of messages:</p><ul><li>A TCP SYN request packet is sent to a server.</li><li>The server sends a SYN/ACK (acknowledgement) in response to the request.</li><li>The client sends a response ACK to the server to complete the session setup.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">This method is a “three-way handshake.”</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In a SYN attack, the attacker exploits the three-way handshake method. First, the attacker sends a fake TCP SYN request to the target server. After the server sends a SYN/ACK in response to the client’s (attacker’s) request, the client never sends an ACK response. This leaves the server waiting to complete the connection.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">SYN flooding takes advantage of the flawed manner in which most hosts implement the TCP three-way handshake. This attack occurs when the attacker sends unlimited SYN packets (requests) to the host system. The process of transmitting such packets is faster than the system can handle. Normally, a connection is established with the TCP three-way handshake. The host keeps track of partially open connections while waiting for response ACK packets in a listening queue.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">As shown in the figure, when Host B receives a SYN request from Host A, it must keep track of the partially opened connection in a “listen queue” for at least 75 s.</p></div>
