  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">These attacks destroy a victimâ€™s ability to reassemble fragmented packets by flooding it with TCP or UDP fragments, resulting in reduced performance. In fragmentation attacks, the attacker sends a large number of fragmented (1500+ byte) packets to a target web server with a relatively small packet rate. Since the protocol allows fragmentation, these packets are usually uninspected as they pass through network equipment such as routers, firewalls, and the intrusion detection system (IDS)/intrusion prevention system (IPS). The reassembly and inspection of these large, fragmented packets consume excessive resources. Moreover, the content in the packet fragments is randomized by the attacker, which makes the reassembly and inspection consume more resources and, in turn, causes the system to crash.</p></div>
