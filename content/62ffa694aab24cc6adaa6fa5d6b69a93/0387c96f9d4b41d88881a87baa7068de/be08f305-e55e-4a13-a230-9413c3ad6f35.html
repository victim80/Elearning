  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">DHCP is a configuration protocol that assigns valid IP addresses to host systems from a pre-assigned DHCP pool. In a DHCP starvation attack, an attacker floods the DHCP server by sending numerous DHCP requests and uses all available IP addresses that the DHCP server can issue. As a result, the server cannot issue any more IP addresses, leading to a DoS attack. Because of this issue, valid users cannot obtain or renew their IP addresses; thus, they fail to access their network. An attacker broadcasts DHCP requests with spoofed MAC addresses with the help of tools such as Yersinia, Hyenae, and Gobbler.</p></div>
