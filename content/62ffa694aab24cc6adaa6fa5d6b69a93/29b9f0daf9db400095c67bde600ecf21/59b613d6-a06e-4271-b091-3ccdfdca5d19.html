  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">In a Smurf attack, the attacker spoofs the source IP address with the victim’s IP address and sends a large number of ICMP ECHO request packets to an IP broadcast network. This causes all the hosts on the broadcast network to respond to the received ICMP ECHO requests. These responses are sent to the victim’s machine because the IP address was spoofed by the attacker, causing significant traffic to the victim’s machine, and ultimately making it crash.</p></div>
