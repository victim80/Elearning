  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <em>https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;">A DDoS attack is a large-scale, coordinated attack on the availability of services on a victim’s system or network resources, and it is launched indirectly through many compromised computers (botnets) on the Internet.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">As defined by the World Wide Web Security FAQ, “A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack uses many computers to launch a coordinated DoS attack against one or more targets. Using client/server technology, the perpetrator is able to multiply the effectiveness of the denial of service significantly by harnessing the resources of multiple unwitting accomplice computers, which serve as attack platforms.” The flood of incoming messages to the target system essentially forces it to shut down, thereby denying service to legitimate users.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The services under attack belong to the “primary victim,” whereas the compromised systems used to launch the attack are called “secondary victims.” The use of secondary victims in performing a DDoS attack enables the attacker to mount a large and disruptive attack while making it difficult to track down the original attacker.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The primary objective of a DDoS attack is to first gain administrative access on as many systems as possible. In general, attackers use a customized attack script to identify potentially vulnerable systems. After gaining access to the target systems, the attacker uploads and runs DDoS software on these systems at the time chosen to launch the attack.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">DDoS attacks have become popular because of the easy accessibility of exploit plans and the negligible amount of brainwork required to execute them. These attacks can be very dangerous because they can quickly consume the largest hosts on the Internet, rendering them useless. The impacts of DDoS include the loss of goodwill, disabled networks, financial losses, and disabled organizations.</p><p><strong>How do DDoS Attacks Work?</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">In a DDoS attack, many applications barrage a target browser or network with fake exterior requests that make the system, network, browser, or site slow, useless, and disabled or unavailable.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The attacker initiates the DDoS attack by sending a command to zombie agents, which are Internet-connected computers compromised by an attacker through malware programs to perform various malicious activities through a command and control (C&amp;C) server. These zombie agents send a connection request to a large number of reflector systems with the spoofed IP address of the victim, which causes the reflector systems to presume that these requests originate from the victim’s machine instead of the zombie agents. Hence, the reflector systems send the requested information (response to the connection request) to the victim. Consequently, the victim’s machine is flooded with unsolicited responses from several reflector computers simultaneously, which may either reduce the performance or cause the victim’s machine to shut down completely.</p></div>
