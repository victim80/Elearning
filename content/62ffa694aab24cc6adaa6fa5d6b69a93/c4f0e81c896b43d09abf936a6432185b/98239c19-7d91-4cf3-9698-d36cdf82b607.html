  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">The following protocols are vulnerable to sniffing. The main reason for sniffing these protocols is to acquire passwords.</p><p><strong>Telnet and Rlogin</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Telnet is a protocol used for communicating with a remote host (via port 23) on a network using a command-line terminal. rlogin enables an attacker to log into a network machine remotely via a TCP connection. Neither of these protocols provides encryption; therefore, data traveling between clients connected through any of these protocols are in plaintext and vulnerable to sniffing. Attackers can sniff keystrokes, including usernames and passwords.</p><p><strong>HTTP</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Due to vulnerabilities in the default version of HTTP, websites implementing HTTP transfer user data across the network in plaintext, which attackers can read to steal user credentials.</p><p><strong>SNMP</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a TCP/IP-based protocol used for exchanging management information between devices connected on a network. The first version of SNMP (SNMPv1) does not offer strong security, which leads to the transfer of data in a cleartext format. Attackers exploit the vulnerabilities in this version to acquire passwords in plaintext.</p><p><strong>POP</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Post Office Protocol (POP) allows a user’s workstation to access mail from a mailbox server. A user can send mail from the workstation to the mailbox server via SMTP. Attackers can easily sniff the data flowing across a POP network in cleartext because of the protocol’s weak security implementations.</p><p><strong>IMAP</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) allows a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a server. This protocol offers inadequate security, which allows attackers to obtain data and user credentials in cleartext.</p><p><strong>SMTP</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used for transmitting email messages over the Internet. In most implementations, SMTP messages are transmitted in cleartext, which enables attackers to capture plaintext passwords. Further, SMTP does not provide any protection against sniffing attacks.</p><p><strong>NNTP</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) distributes, inquires into, retrieves, and posts news articles using a reliable stream-based transmission of news among the ARPA-Internet community. However, this protocol fails to encrypt the data, which allows attackers to sniff sensitive information.</p><p><strong>FTP</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">File Transfer Protocol (FTP) enables clients to share files between computers in a network. This protocol fails to provide encryption; therefore, attackers can sniff data, including user credentials.</p></div>
