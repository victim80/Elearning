  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A web server sends a session identification token or key to a web client after successful authentication. These session tokens differentiate multiple sessions that the server establishes with clients. Web servers use various mechanisms to generate random tokens and controls to secure the tokens during transmission.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Session hijacking is an attack in which an attacker takes over a valid Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) communication session between two computers. Because most types of authentication are performed only at the start of a TCP session, an attacker can gain access to a machine while a session is in progress. Attackers can sniff all the traffic from established TCP sessions and perform identity theft, information theft, fraud, etc.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A session hijacking attack exploits a session-token generation mechanism or token security controls so that the attacker can establish an unauthorized connection with a target server. The attacker can guess or steal a valid session ID, which identifies authenticated users, and use it to establish a session with the server. The web server responds to the attackerâ€™s requests under the impression that it is communicating with an authenticated user.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers can use session hijacking to launch various kinds of attacks, such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. In an MITM attack, an attacker places themselves between an authorized client and a server by performing session hijacking to ensure that information flowing in either direction passes through them. However, the client and server believe they are directly communicating with each other. Attackers can also sniff sensitive information and disrupt sessions to launch a DoS attack.</p></div>
