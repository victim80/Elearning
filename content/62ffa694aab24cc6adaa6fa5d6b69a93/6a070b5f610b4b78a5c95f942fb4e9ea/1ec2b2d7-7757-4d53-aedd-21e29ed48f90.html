  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers run sniffers to convert the host systemâ€™s NIC to promiscuous mode. As discussed earlier, the NIC in promiscuous mode can then capture packets addressed to the specific network.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">There are two types of sniffing. Each is used for different types of networks. The two types are:</p><ul><li>Passive sniffing</li><li>Active sniffing</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Passive Sniffing</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Passive sniffing involves sending no packets. It simply captures and monitors the packets flowing in the network. A packet sniffer alone is not preferred for an attack because it works only in a common collision domain. A common collision domain is the sector of the network that is not switched or bridged (i.e., connected through a hub). Common collision domains are present in hub environments. A network that uses hubs to connect systems uses passive sniffing. In such networks, all hosts in the network can see all the traffic. Hence, it is easy to capture traffic through the hub using passive sniffing.</p></div>
