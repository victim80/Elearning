An attacker can install these on a victim’s machine to compromise it. After compromising the victim’s machine, the attacker can install a packet sniffer and perform sniffing.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">Most modern networks use switches instead of hubs. A switch eliminates the risk of passive sniffing. However, a switch is still vulnerable to active sniffing.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Note</strong>: Passive sniffing provides significant stealth advantages over active sniffing.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Active Sniffing</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Active sniffing searches for traffic on a switched LAN by actively injecting traffic into it. Active sniffing also refers to sniffing through a switch. In active sniffing, the switched Ethernet does not transmit information to all the systems connected through LAN as it does in a hub-based network. For this reason, a passive sniffer is unable to sniff data on a switched network. It is easy to detect these sniffer programs and highly difficult to perform this type of sniffing.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Switches examine data packets for source and destination addresses and then transmit them to the appropriate destinations. Therefore, it is cumbersome to sniff switches. However, attackers can actively inject ARP traffic into a LAN to sniff around a switched network and capture the traffic. Switches maintain their own ARP cache in Content Addressable Memory (CAM). CAM is a special type of memory that maintains a record of which host is connected to which port. A sniffer records all the information visible on the network for future review. An attacker can see all the information in the packets, including data that should remain hidden.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">To summarize the types of sniffing: passive sniffing does not send any packets; it only monitors the packets sent by others. Active sniffing involves sending out multiple network probes to identify access points.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following is a list of different active sniffing techniques:</p><ul><li>MAC flooding</li><li>DNS poisoning</li><li>ARP poisoning</li><li>DHCP attacks</li><li>Switch port stealing</li><li>Spoofing attack</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p></div>
