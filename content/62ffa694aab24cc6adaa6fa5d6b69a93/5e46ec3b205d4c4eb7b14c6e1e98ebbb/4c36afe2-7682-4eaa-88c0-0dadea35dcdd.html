  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Session hijacking can be either active or passive, depending on the degree of involvement of the attacker. The essential difference between an active and passive hijack is that while an active hijack takes over an existing session, a passive hijack monitors an ongoing session.</p><p><strong>Passive Session Hijacking</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">In a passive attack, after hijacking a session, an attacker only observes and records all the traffic during the session. A passive attack uses sniffers on the network, allowing attackers to obtain information such as user IDs and passwords. The attacker can later use this information to log in as a valid user and enjoy the userâ€™s privileges. Password sniffing is the simplest attack to obtain raw access to a network. Countering this attack involves methods that range from identification schemes (for example, one-time password systems such as S/KEY) to ticketing identification (for example, Kerberos). These techniques help in protecting data from sniffing attacks, but they cannot protect against active attacks if the data are unencrypted or do not carry a digital signature.</p><p><strong>Active Session Hijacking</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">In an active attack, an attacker takes over an existing session either by breaking the connection on one side of the conversation or by actively participating. An example of an active attack is a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. To perform a successful MITM attack, the attacker must guess the sequence number before the target responds to the server. On most current networks, sequence-number prediction does not work, because operating-system (OS) vendors use random values for the initial sequence number, which makes it difficult to predict sequence numbers.</p></div>
