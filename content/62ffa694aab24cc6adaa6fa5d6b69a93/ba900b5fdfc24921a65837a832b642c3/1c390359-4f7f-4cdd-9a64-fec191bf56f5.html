  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Packet sniffing is the process of monitoring and capturing all data packets passing through a given network using a software application or hardware device. Sniffing is straightforward in hub-based networks, as the traffic on a segment passes through all the hosts associated with that segment. However, most networks today work on switches. A switch is an advanced computer networking device. The major difference between a hub and a switch is that a hub transmits line data to each port on the machine and has no line mapping, whereas a switch looks at the Media Access Control (MAC) address associated with each frame passing through it and sends the data to the required port. A MAC address is a hardware address that uniquely identifies each node of a network.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">An attacker needs to manipulate the functionality of the switch to see all the traffic passing through it. A packet sniffing program (also known as a sniffer) can capture data packets only from within a given subnet, which means that it cannot sniff packets from another network. Often, any laptop can plug into a network and gain access to it. Many enterprises’ switch ports are open. A packet sniffer placed on a network in promiscuous mode can therefore capture and analyze all the network traffic. Sniffing programs turn off the filter employed by Ethernet network interface cards (NICs) to prevent the host machine from seeing other stations’ traffic. Thus, sniffing programs can monitor all traffic.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Although most networks today employ switch technology, packet sniffing is still useful. This is because installing remote sniffing programs on network components with heavy traffic flows such as servers and routers is relatively easy. It allows an attacker to observe and access the entire network traffic from one point. Packet sniffers can capture data packets containing sensitive information such as passwords, account information, syslog traffic, router configuration, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DNS traffic, email traffic, web traffic, chat sessions, and FTP passwords. This allows an attacker to read passwords in cleartext, the actual emails, credit card numbers, financial transactions, etc. It also allows an attacker to sniff SMTP, POP, IMAP traffic, IMAP, HTTP Basic, telnet authentication, SQL database, SMB, NFS, and FTP traffic. An attacker can gain a substantial amount of information by reading captured data packets; then, the attacker can use that information to break into the network. An attacker carries out more effective attacks by combining these techniques with active transmission.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following diagram depicts an attacker sniffing the data packets between two legitimate network users:</p></div>
