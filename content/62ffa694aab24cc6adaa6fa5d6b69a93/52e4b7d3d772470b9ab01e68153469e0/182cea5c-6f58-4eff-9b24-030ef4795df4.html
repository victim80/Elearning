To understand blind hijacking, it is important to understand sequence-number prediction. TCP sequence numbers, which are unique per byte in a TCP session, provide flow control and data integrity. TCP segments provide the initial sequence number (ISN) as a part of each segment header. ISNs do not start at zero for each session. As part of the handshake process, each participant needs to state the ISN, and bytes are numbered sequentially from that point.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Blind session hijacking relies on the attacker’s ability to predict or guess sequence numbers. An attacker is unable to spoof a trusted host on a different network and observe the reply packets because no route exists for the packets to return to the attacker’s IP address. Moreover, the attacker is unable resort to Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache poisoning because routers do not broadcast ARP across the Internet. Because the attacker is unable to observe the replies, they must anticipate the responses from the victim and prevent the host from sending a TCP/RST packet to the victim. The attacker predicts sequence numbers that the remote host expects from the victim and then hijacks the communication. This method is useful to exploit the trust relationships between users and remote machines.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In a spoofing attack, an attacker pretends to be another user or machine (victim) to gain access. Instead of taking over an existing active session, the attacker initiates a new session using the victim’s stolen credentials. Simple IP spoofing is easy to perform and is useful in various attack methods. To create new raw packets, the attacker must have root access on the machine. However, to establish a spoofed connection using this session hijacking technique, an attacker must know the sequence numbers used by a target machine. IP spoofing forces the attacker to forecast the NSN. When an attacker uses blind hijacking to send a command, they cannot view the response.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In the case of IP spoofing without a session hijack, guessing the sequence number is unnecessary because no currently open session exists with that IP address. In a session hijack, the traffic returns to the attacker only if source routing is used. Source routing is a process that allows the sender to specify the route to be taken by an IP packet to the destination. The attacker performs source routing and then sniffs the traffic as it passes by the attacker. In session spoofing, captured authentication credentials are used to establish a session. In contrast, active hijacking eclipses a pre-existing session. As a result of this attack, a legitimate user may lose access or the normal functionality of their established Telnet session because an attacker hijacks the session and acts with the user’s privileges. Because most authentication mechanisms are enforced only at the initiation of a session, the attacker can gain access to a target machine without authentication while a session is in progress.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Another method is to use source routed IP packets. This type of MITM attack allows an attacker to become a part of the target–host conversation by deceptively guiding IP packets to pass through their system.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Session hijacking is the process of taking over an existing active session. An attacker relies on a legitimate user to make a connection and authenticate. Session hijacking is more difficult than IP address spoofing. In session hijacking, John (an attacker) would seek to insert himself into a session that James (a legitimate user) already had set up with \\Mail. John would wait until James establishes a session, displace James from the established session by some means, such as a DoS attack, and then pick up the session as though he were James. Subsequently, John would send a scripted set of packets to \\Mail and observe the responses. For this purpose, John needs to know the sequence number in use when he hijacked the session. To calculate the sequence number, he must know the ISN and the number of packets involved in the exchange process.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Successful session hijacking is difficult without the use of known tools and is only possible when several factors are under the attacker’s control. Knowledge of the ISN is the least of John’s challenges. For instance, John needs a method to displace James from the active session as well as a method to know the exact status of James’s session at the moment that James is displaced. Both these tasks require John to have far more knowledge and control over the session than would normally be possible.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">However, IP address spoofing attacks can only be successful if an attacker uses IP addresses for authentication. They cannot perform IP address spoofing or session hijacking if per-packet integrity checking is executed. In the same manner, IP address spoofing or session hijacking is not possible if the session uses encryption methods such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP). Consequently, the attacker cannot participate in the key exchange.</p></div>
