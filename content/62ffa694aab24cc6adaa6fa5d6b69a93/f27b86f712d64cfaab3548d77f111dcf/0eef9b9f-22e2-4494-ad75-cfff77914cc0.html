  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A distributed reflection DoS (DRDoS) attack, also known as a “spoofed” attack, involves the use of multiple intermediary and secondary machines that contribute to a DDoS attack against a target machine or application. A DRDoS attack exploits the TCP three-way handshake vulnerability.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">This attack involves an attacker machine, intermediary victims (zombies), secondary victims (reflectors), and a target machine. The attacker launches this attack by sending requests to the intermediary hosts, which in turn reflect the attack traffic to the target.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The process of a DRDoS attack is as follows. First, the attacker commands the intermediary victims (zombies) to send a stream of packets (TCP SYN) with the primary target’s IP address as the source IP address to other non-compromised machines (secondary victims or reflectors) in order to exhort them to establish a connection with the primary target. Consequently, the reflectors send a huge volume of traffic (SYN/ACK) to the primary target to establish a new connection with it because they believe the host requested it. The primary target discards the SYN/ACK packets received from the reflectors because they did not send the SYN packet. Meanwhile, the reflectors wait for the ACK response from the primary target. Assuming that the packet was lost, the reflector machines resend SYN/ACK packets to the primary target to establish the connection, until a time-out occurs. In this manner, the target machine is flooded with a heavy volume of traffic from the reflector machines. The combined bandwidth of these reflector machines overwhelms the target machine.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A DRDoS attack is an intelligent attack because it is very difficult or even impossible to trace the attacker. Instead of the actual attacker, the secondary victims (reflectors) seem to attack the primary target directly. This attack is more effective than a typical DDoS attack because multiple intermediary and secondary victims generate huge attack bandwidth.</p></div>
