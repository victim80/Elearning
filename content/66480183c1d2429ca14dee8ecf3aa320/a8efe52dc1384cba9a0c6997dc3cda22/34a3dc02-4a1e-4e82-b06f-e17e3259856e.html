They can use malware to steal information, delete data, change system settings, provide access, or merely multiply and occupy space. Malware is capable of propagating and functioning secretly.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Certain essential components of most malware programs are as follows:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Crypter</strong>: This is a software that can conceal the existence of malware. Attackers use this software to elude antivirus detection. It protects malware from reverse engineering or analysis, thus making it difficult to detect by security mechanisms.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Downloader</strong>: This is a type of Trojan that downloads other malware (or) malicious code and files from the Internet to a PC or device. Usually, attackers install a downloader when they first gain access to a system.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dropper</strong>: This is a covert carrier of malware. Attackers embed notorious malware files inside droppers, which can perform the installation task covertly. Attackers need to first install the malware program or code on the system to execute the dropper. The dropper can transport malware code and execute malware on a target system without being detected by antivirus scanners.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Exploit</strong>: This is that part of the malware that contains code or a sequence of commands that can take advantage of a bug or vulnerability in a digital system or device. Attackers use such code to breach the systemâ€™s security through software vulnerabilities to spy on information or to install malware. Based on the type of vulnerabilities abused, exploits are categorized into local exploits and remote exploits.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Injector</strong>: This program injects exploits or malicious code available in the malware into other vulnerable running processes and it changes the method of execution in order to hide or prevent its removal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Obfuscator</strong>: This is a program that conceals the malicious code of malware via various techniques, thereby making it difficult for security mechanisms to detect or remove it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Packer</strong>: This software compresses the malware file to convert the code and data of the malware into an unreadable format. It uses compression techniques to pack the malware.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Payload</strong>: This is the part of the malware that performs the desired activity when activated. It may be used for deleting or modifying files, degrading the system performance, opening ports, changing settings, and so on, to compromise system security.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Malicious code</strong>: This is a piece of code that defines the basic functionality of the malware and comprises commands that result in security breaches. It can take the following forms:</p><ul><li>Java applets</li><li>ActiveX controls</li><li>Browser plug-ins</li><li>Pushed content</li></ul></div>
