  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Ransomware is a type of malware that restricts access to the infected computer system or critical files and documents stored on it, and then demands an online ransom payment to the malware creator(s) to remove user restrictions. Ransomware is a type of crypto-malware that might encrypt files stored on the system’s hard disk or merely lock the system and display messages meant to trick the user into paying the ransom.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Usually, ransomware spreads as a Trojan, entering a system through email attachments, hacked websites, infected programs, app downloads from untrusted sites, vulnerabilities in network services, and so on. After execution, the payload in the ransomware runs and encrypts the victim’s data (files and documents), which can be decrypted only by the malware author. In some cases, user interaction is restricted using a simple payload.</p><p>In a web browser, a text file or webpage displays the ransomware demands. The displayed messages appear to be from companies or law enforcement personnel falsely claiming that the victim’s system is being used for illegal purposes or contains illegal content (e.g., porn videos, pirated software), or it could be a Microsoft product activation notice falsely claiming that installed Office software is fake and requires product re-activation. These messages entice victims into paying money to undo the restrictions imposed on them. Ransomware leverages victims’ fear, trust, surprise, and embarrassment to get them to pay the ransom demanded.</p></div>
