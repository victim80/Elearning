  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:center;">Figure 3.1: Classification of Threat Sources</p><p><strong>Natural Threats</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Natural factors such as fires, floods, power failures, lightning, meteor, and earthquakes are potential threats to the assets of an organization. For example, these may cause severe physical damage to computer systems.</p><p><strong>Unintentional Threats</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Unintentional threats are threats that exist due to the potential for unintentional errors occurring within the organization. Examples include insider-originating security breaches, negligence, operator errors, unskilled administrators, lazy or untrained employees, and accidents.</p><p><strong>Intentional Threats</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">There are two sources of intentional threats.</p><p><strong>Internal Threats</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Most computer and Internet-related crimes are insiders or internal attacks. These threats are performed by insiders within the organization such as disgruntled or negligent employees and harm the organization intentionally or unintentionally. Most of these attacks are performed by privileged users of the network.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The causes for insider attacks could be revenge, disrespect, frustration, or lack of security awareness. Insider attacks are more dangerous than external attacks because insiders are familiar with the network architecture, security policies, and regulations of the organization. Additionally, security measures and solutions typically focus more on external attacks, potentially leading an organization to be underequipped to identify and counter internal attacks.</p><p><strong>External Threats</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">External attacks are performed by exploiting vulnerabilities that already exist in a network, without the assistance of insider employees. Therefore, the potential to perform an external attack depends on the severity of the identified network weaknesses. Attackers may perform such attacks for financial gain, to damage the reputation of the target organization, or simply for the sake of curiosity. External attackers can be individuals with expertise in attack techniques or a group of people who work together with a shared motive. For example, attacks can be performed with the objective of supporting a cause, by competitor companies for corporate espionage, and by countries for surveillance. Attackers performing external attacks have a predefined plan and use specialized tools and techniques to successfully penetrate networks. External attacks can include application- and virus-based attacks, password-based attacks, instant messaging–based attacks, network traffic–based attacks, and operating system (OS)–based attacks.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">External threats are further classified into two types.</p><p><strong>Structured external threats</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Structured external threats are implemented by technically skilled attackers, using various tools to gain access into a network, with the aim of disrupting services. The motivation behind such attacks includes criminal bribes, racism, politics, terrorism, etc. Examples include distributed ICMP floods, spoofing, and simultaneously executing attacks from multiple sources. Tracking and identifying an attacker executing such an attack can be challenging.</p><p><strong>Unstructured external threats</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Unstructured external threats are implemented by unskilled attackers, typically script kiddies who may be aspiring hackers, to access networks. Most of these attacks are performed primarily out of curiosity, rather than with criminal intentions. For example, untrained attackers use freely available online tools for attempting a network attack or for crashing a website or other public domains on the Internet. Unstructured external threats can easily be prevented by adopting security solutions such as port-scanning and address-sweeping tools. &nbsp;</p></div>
