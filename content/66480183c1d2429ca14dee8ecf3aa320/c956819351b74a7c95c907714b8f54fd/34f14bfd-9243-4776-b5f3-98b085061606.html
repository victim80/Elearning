  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Fileless malware, also called non-malware, infects legitimate software, applications, and other protocols existing in the system to perform various malicious activities. This type of malware leverages existing vulnerabilities to infect the system. It generally resides in the systemâ€™s RAM. It injects malicious code into running processes such as Microsoft Word, Flash, Adobe PDF Reader, Javascript, PowerShell, .NET, malicious Macros, and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Fileless malware does not depend on files and leaves no traces, thereby making it difficult to detect and remove using traditional anti-malware solutions. Therefore, such malware is highly resistant to computer forensics techniques. It mostly resides in volatile memory locations such as running processes, system registry, and service areas. Once the fileless malware gains access to the target system, it can exploit system administration tools and processes to maintain persistence, escalate privileges, and move laterally across the target network. Attackers use such malware to steal critical data from the system, install other types of malware, or inject malicious scripts that automatically execute with every system restart to continue the attack.</p></div>
