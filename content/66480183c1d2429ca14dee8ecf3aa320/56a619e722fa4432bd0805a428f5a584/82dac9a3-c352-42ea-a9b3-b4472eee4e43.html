  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Viruses are categories according to their functioning and targets. Some of the most common types of computer viruses that adversely affect the security of systems are listed below:</p><ol><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>System or Boot Sector Virus:</strong> The most common targets for a virus are the system sectors, which include the master boot record (MBR) and the DOS boot record system sectors. The primary carriers of system or boot sector viruses are email attachments and removable media (USB drives). A boot sector virus moves MBR to another location on the hard disk and copies itself to the original location of MBR. When the system boots, first, the virus code executes and then control passes to the original MBR.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>File Virus:&nbsp;</strong>File viruses infect files executed or interpreted in the system, such as COM, EXE, SYS, OVL, OBJ, PRG, MNU, and BAT files. File viruses can be direct-action (non-resident) or memory-resident viruses. File viruses insert their code into the original file and infect executable files. Such viruses are numerous, albeit rare. They infect in a variety of ways and are found in numerous file types.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Multipartite Virus:</strong> A multipartite virus (also known as a multipart virus or hybrid virus) combines the approach of file infectors and boot record infectors and attempts to simultaneously attack both the boot sector and the executable or program files. When the virus infects the boot sector, it will, in turn, affect the system files and vice versa. This type of virus re-infects a system repeatedly if it is not rooted out entirely from the target machine. Some examples of multipartite viruses include Invader, Flip, and Tequila.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Macro Virus:</strong> Macro viruses infects Microsoft Word or similar applications by automatically performing a sequence of actions after triggering an application. Most macro viruses are written using the macro language Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), and they infect templates or convert infected documents into template files while maintaining their appearance of common document files.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Cluster Virus:</strong> Cluster viruses infect files without changing the file or planting additional files. They save the virus code to the hard drive and overwrite the pointer in the directory entry, directing the disk read point to the virus code instead of the actual program. Even though the changes in the directory entry may affect all the programs, only one copy of the virus exists on the disk.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Stealth/Tunneling Virus:</strong> These viruses try to hide from antivirus programs by actively altering and corrupting the service call interrupts while running. The virus code replaces the requests to perform operations with respect to these service call interrupts. These viruses state false information to hide their presence from antivirus programs. For example, a stealth virus hides the operations that it modified and gives false representations. Thus, it takes over portions of the target system and hides its virus code.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Encryption Virus:</strong> Encryption viruses or cryptolocker viruses penetrate the target system via freeware, shareware, codecs, fake advertisements, torrents, email spam, and so on. This type of virus consists of an encrypted copy of the virus and a decryption module. The decryption module remains constant, whereas the encryption makes use of different keys.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sparse Infector Virus:</strong> To spread infection, viruses typically attempt to hide from antivirus programs. Sparse infector viruses infect less often and try to minimize their probability of discovery. These viruses infect only occasionally upon satisfying certain conditions or infect only those files whose lengths fall within a narrow range.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Polymorphic Virus:</strong> Such viruses infect a file with an encrypted copy of a polymorphic code already decoded by a decryption module. Polymorphic viruses modify their code for each replication to avoid detection. They accomplish this by changing the encryption module and the instruction sequence. Polymorphic mechanisms use random number generators in their implementation.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Metamorphic Virus:</strong> Metamorphic viruses are programmed such that they rewrite themselves completely each time they infect a new executable file. Such viruses are sophisticated and use metamorphic engines for their execution. Metamorphic code reprograms itself. It is translated into temporary code (a new variant of the same virus but with different code) and then converted back into the original code. This technique, in which the original algorithm remains intact, is used to avoid pattern recognition by antivirus software. Metamorphic viruses are more effective than polymorphic viruses.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Overwriting File or Cavity Virus:</strong> Some programs have empty spaces in them. Cavity viruses, also known as space fillers, overwrite a part of the host file with a constant (usually nulls), without increasing the length of the file while preserving its functionality. Maintaining a constant file size when infecting allows the virus to avoid detection. Cavity viruses are rarely found due to the unavailability of hosts and code complexity.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Companion Virus/Camouflage Virus:</strong> The companion virus stores itself with the same filename as the target program file. The virus infects the computer upon executing the file, and it modifies the hard disk data. Companion viruses use DOS to run COM files before the execution of EXE files. The virus installs an identical COM file and infects EXE files.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shell Virus:&nbsp;</strong>The shell virus code forms a shell around the target host program’s code, making itself the original program with the host code as its sub-routine. Nearly all boot program viruses are shell viruses.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>File Extension Virus:&nbsp;</strong>File extension viruses change the extensions of files. The extension .TXT is safe as it indicates a pure text file. With extensions turned off, if someone sends you a file named BAD.TXT.VBS, you will only see BAD.TXT. If you have forgotten that extensions are turned off, you might think that this is a text file and open it. It actually is an executable Visual Basic Script virus file and could cause severe damage.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>FAT Virus:</strong> A FAT virus is a computer virus that attacks the File Allocation Table (FAT), a system used in Microsoft products and some other types of computer systems to access the information stored on a computer. By attacking the FAT, a virus can cause severe damage to a computer. FAT viruses can work in a variety of ways. Some are designed to embed themselves into files so that when the FAT accesses the file, the virus is triggered. Others may attack the FAT directly.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Logic Bomb Virus:&nbsp;</strong>A logic bomb is a virus that is triggered by a response to an event, such as the launching of an application or when a specific date/time is reached, where it involves logic to execute the trigger. When a logic bomb is programmed to execute on a specific date, it is referred to as a time bomb. Time bombs are usually programmed to set off when important dates are reached, such as Christmas and Valentine’s Day.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Web Scripting Virus:</strong> A web scripting virus is a type of computer security vulnerability that breaches your web browser security through a website. This allows attackers to inject client-side scripting into the web page. It can bypass access controls and steal information from the web browser. Web scripting viruses are usually used to attack sites with large populations, such as sites for social networking, user reviews, and email.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Email Virus:</strong> An e-mail virus refers to computer code sent to you as an e-mail attachment, which if activated, will result in some unexpected and usually harmful effects, such as destroying specific files on your hard disk and causing the attachment to be emailed to everyone in your address book. Email viruses perform a wide variety of activities, from creating pop-ups to crashing systems or stealing personal data.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Armored Virus:</strong> Armored viruses are viruses that are designed to confuse or trick deployed antivirus systems to prevent them from detecting the actual source of the infection. These viruses make it difficult for antivirus programs to trace the actual source of the attack. They trick antivirus programs by showing some other location even though they are actually on the system itself.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Add-on Virus:</strong> Add-on viruses append their code to the host code without making any changes to the latter or relocate the host code to insert their code at the beginning.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Intrusive Virus:</strong> Intrusive viruses overwrite the host code completely or partly with the viral code.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Direct Action or Transient Virus:</strong> Direct action or transient viruses transfer all controls of the host code to where it resides in the memory. It selects the target program to be modified and corrupts it. The life of a transient virus is directly proportional to the life of its host. Therefore, transient virus executes only upon the execution of its attached program and terminates upon the termination of its attached program. At the time of execution, the virus may spread to other programs. This virus is transient or direct, as it operates only for a short period and goes directly to the disk to search for programs to infect.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Terminate and Stay Resident Virus (TSR</strong>): A terminate and stay resident (TSR) virus remains permanently in the target machine’s memory during an entire work session, even after the target host’s program is executed and terminated. The TSR virus remains in memory and therefore has some control over the processes.</li></ol></div>
