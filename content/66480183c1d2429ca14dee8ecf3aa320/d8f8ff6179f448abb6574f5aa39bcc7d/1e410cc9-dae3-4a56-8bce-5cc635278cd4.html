  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Vulnerability exploitation involves the execution of multiple complex, interrelated steps to gain access to a remote system. Attackers can perform exploitation only after discovering vulnerabilities in that target system. Attackers use discovered vulnerabilities to develop exploits and deliver and execute the exploits on the remote system.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Steps involved in exploiting vulnerabilities:</p><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Identify the Vulnerability</strong>: Attackers identify the vulnerabilities that exist in the target system using various techniques such as footprinting and reconnaissance, scanning, enumeration, and vulnerability analysis. After identifying the OSs used and vulnerable services running on the target system, attackers also use various online exploit sites such as Exploit Database (<em>https://www.exploit-db.com</em>) and SecurityFocus (<em>https://www.securityfocus.com</em>) to detect vulnerabilities in underlying OS and applications.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Determine the Risk Associated with the Vulnerability</strong>: After identifying a vulnerability, attackers determine the risk associated with the vulnerability, i.e., whether exploitation of this vulnerability sustains the security measures on the target system.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Determine the Capability of the Vulnerability</strong>: If the risk is low, attackers can determine the capability of exploiting this vulnerability to gain remote access to the target system.&nbsp;</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Develop the Exploit</strong>: After determining the capability of the vulnerability, attackers use exploits from online exploit sites such as Exploit Database (<em>https://www.exploit-db.com</em>), or develop their own exploits using exploitation tools such as Metasploit.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Select the Method for Delivering â€“ Local or Remote</strong>: Attackers perform remote exploitation over a network to exploit vulnerability existing in the remote system to gain shell access. If attackers have prior access to the system, they perform local exploitation to escalate privileges or execute applications in the target system.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Generate and Deliver the Payload</strong>: Attackers, as part of exploitation, generate or select malicious payloads using tools such as Metasploit and deliver it to the remote system either using social engineering or through a network. Attackers inject malicious shellcode in the payloads, which, when executed, establishes a remote shell to the target system.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Gain Remote Access</strong>: After generating the payload, attackers run the exploit to gain remote shell access to the target system. Now, attackers can run various malicious commands on the remote shell and control the system.</li></ol></div>
