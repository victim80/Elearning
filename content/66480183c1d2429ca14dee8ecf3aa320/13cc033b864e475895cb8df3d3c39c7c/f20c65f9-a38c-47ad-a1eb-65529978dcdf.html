  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Phishing emails</strong>: Attackers use phishing emails embedded with malicious links or downloads, which, when clicked, inject and run malicious code in the victim’s memory.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Legitimate applications</strong>: Attackers exploit legitimate system packages installed in the system, such as Word, and JavaScript, to run the malware.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Native applications</strong>: Operating systems such as Windows include pre-installed tools such as PowerShell, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). Attackers exploit these tools to install and run malicious code.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Infection through lateral movemen</strong>t: Once the fileless malware infects the target system, attackers use this system to move laterally in the network and infect other systems connected to the network.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Malicious websites</strong>: Attackers create fraudulent websites that appear legitimate. When a victim visits such a website, it automatically scans the victim’s system to detect vulnerabilities in plugins that can be exploited by the attackers to run malicious code in the browser’s memory.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Registry manipulation</strong>: Attackers use this technique to inject and run malicious code directly from the Windows registry through a legitimate system process. This helps attackers to bypass UAC, application whitelisting, etc., and also infect other running processes.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Memory code injection</strong>: Attackers use this technique to inject malicious code and maintain persistence in the process memory of the running process with the aim of propagating and re-injecting it into other legitimate system processes that are critical for normal system operation. This helps in bypassing regular security controls. The various code injection techniques used by attackers include local shellcode injection, remote thread injection, process hallowing, etc.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Script-based injection</strong>: Attackers often use scripts in which the binaries or shellcode are obfuscated and encoded. Such script-based attacks might not be completely fileless. The scripts are often embedded in documents as email attachments.</li></ul></div>
