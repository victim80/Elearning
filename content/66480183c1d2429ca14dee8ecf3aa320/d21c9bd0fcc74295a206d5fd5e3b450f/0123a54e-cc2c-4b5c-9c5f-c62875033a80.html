These tools are dangerous and can backfire if not properly executed. New Trojans created by attackers remain undetected when scanned by virus- or Trojan-scanning tools, as they do not match any known signatures. This added benefit allows attackers to succeed in launching attacks.</p><p><strong>Theef RAT Trojan</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Theef is a Remote Access Trojan written in Delphi. It allows remote attackers access to the system via port 9871. Theef is a Windows-based application for both client and server. The Theef server is a virus that you install on a target computer, and the Theef client is what you then use to control the virus.</p></div>
