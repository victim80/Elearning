  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Keyloggers are software programs or hardware devices that record the keys struck on the computer keyboard (also called keystroke logging) of an individual computer user or a network of computers. You can view all the keystrokes of the victim’s computer at any time in your system by installing this hardware device or program. It records almost all the keystrokes on a keyboard of a user and saves the recorded information in a text file. As keyloggers hide their processes and interface, the target is unaware of the keylogging. Offices and industries use keyloggers to monitor employees’ computer activities, and they can also be used in home environments for parents to monitor children’s Internet activities.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A keylogger, when associated with spyware, helps to transmit a user’s information to an unknown third party. Attackers use it illegally for malicious purposes, such as stealing sensitive and confidential information about victims. This sensitive information includes email IDs, passwords, banking details, chat room activity, Internet relay chat (IRC), instant messages, and bank and credit card numbers. The data transmitted over the encrypted Internet connection are also vulnerable to keylogging because the keylogger tracks the keystrokes before encryption.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The keylogger program is installed onto the user’s system invisibly through email attachments or “drive-by” downloads when users visit certain websites. Physical keystroke loggers “sit” between keyboard hardware and the OS, so that they can remain undetected and record every keystroke.</p></div>
