  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p><strong>Instant Messenger Applications</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Infection can occur via instant messenger applications such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp Messenger, LinkedIn Messenger, Google Hangouts, or ICQ. Users are at high risk while receiving files via instant messengers. Regardless of who sends the file or from where it is sent, there is always a risk of infection by a Trojan. The user can never be 100% sure of who is at the other end of the connection at any particular moment. For example, if you receive a file through an instant messenger application from a known person such as Bob, you will try to open and view the file. This could be a trick whereby an attacker who has hacked Bob's messenger ID and password wants to spread Trojans across Bob's contacts list to trap more victims.</p><p><strong>Portable Hardware Media/Removable Devices</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Portable hardware media such as flash drives, CDs/ DVDs, and external hard drives can also inject malware into a system. A simple way of injecting malware into the target system is through physical access. For example, if Bob can access Alice’s system in her absence, then he can install a Trojan by copying the Trojan software from his flash drive onto her hard drive.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Another means of portable media malware infection is through the Autorun function. Autorun, also referred to as Autoplay or Autostart, is a Windows feature that, if enabled, runs an executable program when a user inserts a CD/DVD in the DVD-ROM tray or connects a USB device. Attackers can exploit this feature to run malware along with genuine programs. They place an Autorun.inf file with the malware in a CD/DVD or USB device and trick people into inserting or plugging it into their systems. Because many people are not aware of the risks involved, their machines are vulnerable to Autorun malware. The following is the content of an Autorun.inf file:</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[autorun]</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>open=setup.exe</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>icon=setup.exe</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">To mitigate such infection, turn off the Autostart functionality. Follow the instructions below to turn off Autoplay in Windows 10:</p><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Click <strong>Start</strong>. Type <strong>gpedit.msc</strong> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password, or click <strong>Allow</strong>.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Under <strong>Computer Configuration</strong>, expand <strong>Administrative Templates</strong>, expand <strong>Windows Components</strong>, and then click <strong>Autoplay Policies</strong>.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the <strong>Details&nbsp;</strong>pane, double-click <strong>Turn off Autoplay</strong>.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Click <strong>Enabled</strong>, and then select <strong>All drives</strong> in the <strong>Turn off Autoplay</strong> box to disable Autorun on all drives.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Restart&nbsp;</strong>the computer.</li></ol><p><strong>Browser and Email Software Bugs</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Outdated web browsers often contain vulnerabilities that can pose a major risk to the user’s computer. A visit to a malicious site from such browsers can automatically infect the machine without downloading or executing any program. The same scenario occurs while checking e-mail with Outlook Express or some other software with well-known problems. Again, it may infect the user's system without even downloading an attachment. To reduce such risks, always use the latest version of the browser and e-mail software.</p><p><strong>Insecure Patch management</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Unpatched software poses a high risk. Users and IT administrators do not update their application software as often as they should, and many attackers take advantage of this well-known fact. Attackers can exploit insecure patch management by injecting the software with malware that can damage the data stored on the company’s systems. This process can lead to extensive security breaches, such as stealing of confidential files and company credentials. Some applications that were found to be vulnerable and were patched recently include Google Play Core Library (CVE-2020-8913), Cloudflare WARP for Windows (CVE-2020-35152), Oracle WebLogic Server (CVE-2020-14750), and Apache Tomcat (CVE-2021-24122). Patch management must be effective in mitigating threats, and it is vital to apply patches and regularly update software programs.</p><p><strong>Rogue/Decoy Applications</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers can easily lure a victim into downloading free applications/programs. If a free program claims to be loaded with features such as an address book, access to several POP3 accounts, and other functions, many users will be tempted to try it. POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) is an email transfer protocol.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">If a victim downloads free programs and labels them as TRUSTED, protection software such as antivirus software will fail to indicate the use of new software. In this situation, an attacker receives an email, POP3 account passwords, cached passwords, and keystrokes through email without being noticed.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Attackers thrive on creativity. Consider an example in which an attacker creates a fake website (say, Audio galaxy) for downloading MP3s. He or she could generate such a site using 15 GB of space for the MP3s and installing any other systems needed to create the illusion of a website. This can fool users into thinking that they are merely downloading from other network users. However, the software could act as a backdoor and infect thousands of naive users.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Some websites even link to anti-Trojan software, thereby fooling users into trusting them and downloading infected freeware. Included in the setup is a readme.txt file that can deceive almost any user. Therefore, any freeware site requires proper attention before any software is downloaded from it.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Webmasters of well-known security portals, who have access to vast archives containing various hacking programs, should act responsibly with regard to the files they provide and scan them often with antivirus and anti-Trojan software to guarantee that their site is free of Trojans and viruses. Suppose that an attacker submits a program infected with a Trojan (e.g., a UDP flooder) to an archive’s webmaster. If the webmaster is not alert, the attacker may use this opportunity to infect the files on the site with the Trojan. Users who deal with any software or web application should scan their systems daily. If they detect any new file, it is essential to examine it. If any suspicion arises regarding the file, it is also important to forward it to software detection labs for further analysis.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It is easy to infect machines using freeware; thus, extra precautions are necessary.</li></ul><p><strong>Untrusted Sites and Freeware Web Applications/Software</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">A website could be suspicious if it is located at a free website provider or one offering programs for illegal activities.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">It is highly risky to download programs or tools located on “underground” sites, e.g., NeuroticKat software, because they can serve as a conduit for a Trojan attack on target computers. Users must assess the high risk of visiting such sites before browsing them.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Many malicious websites have a professional look, massive archives, feedback forums, and links to other popular sites. Users should scan the files using antivirus software before downloading them. Just because a website looks professional does not mean that it is safe.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Always download popular software from its original (or officially dedicated mirror) site, and not from third-party sites with links to the (supposedly) same software.</li></ul><p><strong>Downloading Files from the Internet</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Trojans enter a system when users download Internet-driven applications such as music players, files, movies, games, greeting cards, and screensavers from malicious websites, thinking that they are legitimate. Microsoft Word and Excel macros are also used effectively to transfer malware and downloaded malicious MS Word/Excel files can infect systems. Malware can also be embedded in audio/video files as well as in video subtitle files.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Email Attachments</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">An attachment to an e-mail is the most common medium to transmit malware. The attachment can be in any form, and the attacker uses innovative ideas to trick the victim into clicking and downloading the attachment. The attachment may be a document, audio file, video file, brochure, invoice, lottery offer letter, job offer letter, loan approval letter, admission form, contract approval, etc.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Example 1: A user’s friend is conducting some research, and the user would like to know more about the friend’s research topic. The user sends an e-mail to the friend to inquire about the topic and waits for a reply. An attacker targeting the user also knows the friend’s e-mail address. The attacker will merely code a program to falsely populate the e-mail “<strong>From</strong>:” field and attach a Trojan in the email. The user will check the email and think that the friend has answered the query in an attachment, download the attachment, and run it without thinking it might be a Trojan, resulting in an infection.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Some email clients, such as Outlook Express, have bugs that automatically execute attached files. To avoid such attacks, use secure email services, investigate the headers of emails with attachments, confirm the sender’s email address, and download the attachment only if the sender is legitimate. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Network Propagation</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Network security is the first line of defense for protecting information systems from hacking incidents. However, various factors such as the replacement of network firewalls and mistakes of operators may sometimes allow unfiltered Internet traffic into private networks. Malware operators continuously attempt connections to addresses within the Internet address range owned by targets to seek an opportunity for unfettered access. Some malware propagates through technological networks. For example, the Blaster starts from a local machine’s IP address or a completely random address and attempts to infect sequential IP addresses. Although network propagation attacks that take advantage of vulnerabilities in common network protocols (e.g., SQL Slammer) have not been prevalent recently, the potential for such attacks still exists.</p><p><strong>File Sharing Services</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">If NetBIOS (Port 139), FTP (Port 21), SMB (Port 145), etc., on a system are open for file sharing or remote execution, they can be used by others to access the system. This can allow attackers to install malware and modify system files.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers can also use a DoS attack to shut down the system and force a reboot so that the Trojan can restart itself immediately. To prevent such attacks, ensure that the file sharing property is disabled. To disable the file sharing option in Windows, click Start and type <strong>Control Panel</strong>. Then, in the results, click on the <strong>Control Panel</strong> option and navigate to <strong>Network and Internet -&gt; Network and Sharing Center -&gt; Change Advanced Sharing Settings</strong>. Select a network profile and under <strong>File and Printer Sharing</strong> section, select <strong>Turn off file and printer sharing</strong>. This will prevent file sharing abuse.</p><p><strong>Installation by other Malware</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A piece of malware that can command and control will often be able to re-connect to the malware operator’s site using common browsing protocols. This functionality allows malware on the internal network to receive both software and commands from the outside. In such cases, the malware installed on one system drives the installation of other malware on the network, thereby causing damage to the network.</p><p><strong>Bluetooth and Wireless Networks</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Attackers use open Bluetooth and Wi-Fi networks to attract users to connect to them. These open networks have software and hardware devices installed at the router level to capture the network traffic and data packets as well as to find the account details of the users, including usernames and passwords.</p></div>
