All organizations that store, transmit, and handle data need to enforce strong security mechanisms to continuously monitor their IT environment in order to identify the vulnerabilities and resolve them before exploitation. It is important to understand the difference between a security threat and a vulnerability. Security threats are incidents that negatively impact the organizationâ€™s IT infrastructure, whereas vulnerabilities are security gaps or flaws in a system or network that make threats possible, tempting hackers to exploit them.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">This module starts with an introduction to threats and threat sources.
