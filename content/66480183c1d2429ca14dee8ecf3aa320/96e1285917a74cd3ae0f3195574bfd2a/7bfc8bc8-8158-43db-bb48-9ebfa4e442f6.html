  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Computer worms are standalone malicious programs that replicate, execute, and spread across network connections independently without human intervention. Intruders design most worms to replicate and spread across a network, thus consuming available computing resources and, in turn, causing network servers, web servers, and individual computer systems to become overloaded and stop responding. However, some worms also carry a payload to damage the host system.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Worms are a subtype of viruses. A worm does not require a host to replicate; however, in some cases, the wormâ€™s host machine is also infected. Initially, black hat professionals treated worms as a mainframe problem. Later, with the introduction of the Internet, they mainly focused on and targeted Windows OS using the same worms by sharing them in via e-mail, IRC, and other network functions.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers use worm payloads to install backdoors on infected computers, which turns them into zombies and creates a botnet. Attackers use these botnets to initiate cyber-attacks. Some of the latest computer worms are as follows:</p><ul><li>Monero</li><li>Bondat</li><li>Beapy</li></ul></div>
