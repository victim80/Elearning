  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Different ways to defend against spyware are as follows:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Try to avoid using any computer system that you do not have a complete control over.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Never adjust your Internet security setting level too low because it provides many chances for spyware to be installed on your computer. Therefore, always set your Internet browser security settings to either high or medium to protect your computer from spyware.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Do not open suspicious emails and file attachments received from unknown senders. There is a high likelihood that you will allow a virus, freeware, or spyware onto the computer. Do not open unknown websites linked in spam mail messages, retrieved by search engines, or displayed in pop-up windows because they may mislead you into downloading spyware.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Enable a firewall to enhance the security level of your computer.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Regularly update the software and use a firewall with outbound protection.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Regularly check Task Manager and MS Configuration Manager reports.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Regularly update virus definition files and scan the system for spyware.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Install anti-spyware software. Anti-spyware is the first line of defense against spyware. This software prevents spyware from installing on your system. It periodically scans and protects your system from spyware.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Keep your OS up to date.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Windows users should periodically perform a Windows or Microsoft update.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>For users of other OSs or software products, refer to the information given by the OS vendors, and take essential steps against any vulnerability identified.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;">Perform web surfing safely and download cautiously.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Before downloading any software, ensure that it is from a trusted website. Read the license agreement, security warning, and privacy statements associated with the software thoroughly to gain a clear understanding before downloading it.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Before downloading freeware or shareware from a website, ensure that the site is safe. Likewise, be cautious with software programs obtained through P2P file-swapping software. Before installing such programs, perform a scan using anti-spyware software.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;">Do not use administrative mode unless it is necessary, because it may execute malicious programs such as spyware in administrator mode. Consequently, attackers may take complete control of your system.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Do not download free music files, screensavers, or emoticons from the Internet because when you do, there is a possibility that are downloading spyware along with them.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Beware of pop-up windows or web pages. Never click anywhere on the windows that display messages such as “your computer may be infected,” or claim that they can help your computer to run faster. If you click on such windows, your system may become infected with spyware.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Carefully read all disclosures, including the license agreement and privacy statement, before installing any application.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Do not store personal or financial information on any computer system that is not totally under your control, such as in an Internet café.</li></ul></div>
