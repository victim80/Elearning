  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A botnet is a collection of compromised computers connected to the Internet to perform a distributed task. Attackers distribute malicious software that turns a user’s computer into a bot, which refers to a program or an infected system that performs repetitive work or acts as an agent or as a user interface to control other programs. The infected computer then performs automated tasks without the user’s permission. Attackers use bots to infect a large number of computers. Cyber-criminals who control bots are called botmasters. Bots spread across the Internet and search for vulnerable and unprotected systems. When it finds an exposed system, it quickly infects the system and reports back to the botmaster.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers use botnets to distribute spam emails and conduct denial-of-service attacks and automated identity thefts. The performance of a computer that is part of a botnet might be affected. Botmasters use infected computers to perform various automated tasks. They may instruct the infected systems to transmit viruses, worms, spam, and spyware. Botmasters also steal personal and private information from the target users such as credit card numbers, bank details, usernames, and passwords. Botmasters launch DoS attacks on specific target users and extort money to restore the users’ control over the compromised resources. Botmasters may also use bots to boost web advertisement billings by automatically clicking on Internet ads.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Bots enter a target system using a payload in a Trojan horse or similar malware. They infect the target system through drive-by-downloads, or by sending spam mails that are embedded with malicious content.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The figure illustrates how an attacker launches a botnet-based DoS attack on a target server. The attacker sets up a bot C&amp;C center, following which they infect a machine (bot) and compromises it. Later, they use this bot to infect and compromise other vulnerable systems available in the network, resulting in a botnet. The bots (also known as zombies) connect to the C&amp;C center and awaits instructions. Subsequently, the attacker sends malicious commands to the bots through the C&amp;C center. Finally, as per the attacker’s instructions, the bots launch a DoS attack on a target server, making its services unavailable to legitimate users in the network.</p></div>
