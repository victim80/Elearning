Such activities reflect the nature of a virus by interrupting the regular flow of a process or a program. However, not all bugs created contribute toward attacking the system; they may be merely false positives. For example, if the system runs slower than usual, one may assume that a virus has infected the system; however, the actual reason might be program overload.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">An effective virus tends to multiply rapidly and may infect some machines in a short period. Viruses can infect files on the system, and when such files are transferred, they can infect machines of other users who receive them. A virus can also use file servers to infect files.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">When a virus infects a computer, the victim or user will be able to identify some indications of the presence of virus infection.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Some indications of computer virus infection are as follows:</p></div><ul><li>Processes require more resources and time, resulting in degraded performance</li><li>Computer beeps with no display</li><li>Drive label changes and OS does not load</li><li>Constant antivirus alerts</li><li>Computer freezes frequently or encounters an error such as BSOD</li><li>Files and folders are missing</li><li>Suspicious hard drive activity</li><li>Browser window “freezes”</li><li>Lack of storage space</li><li>Unwanted advertisements and pop-up windows</li><li>Unable to open files in the system</li><li>Strange emails received</li></ul></div>
