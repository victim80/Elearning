  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Adware refers to software or a program that supports advertisements and generates unsolicited ads and pop-ups. It tracks cookies and user browsing patterns for marketing purposes and to display advertisements. It collects user data such as visited websites to customize advertisements for the user. Legitimate software can be embedded with adware to generate revenue, in which case the adware is considered a legitimate alternative provided to customers who do not wish to pay for the software. In some cases, legitimate software may be embedded with adware by an attacker or a third party to generate revenue.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Software containing legitimate adware typically provides the option to disable ads by purchasing a registration key. Software developers utilize adware as a means to reduce development costs and increase profits. Adware enables them to offer software for free or at reduced prices, motivating them to design, maintain, and upgrade their software products.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Adware typically requires an Internet connection to run. Common adware programs include toolbars on a user’s desktop or those that work in conjunction with the user’s web browser. Adware may perform advanced searches on the web or a user’s hard drive and may provide features to improve the organization of bookmarks and shortcuts. Advanced adware may also include games and utilities that are free to use but display advertisements while the programs launch. For example, users may be required to wait until an ad is completed before watching a YouTube video.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">While adware can be beneficial by offering an alternative to paid software, attackers can misuse adware to exploit users. When legitimate adware is uninstalled, the ads should stop. Further, legitimate adware requests a user for permission before collecting user data. However, when user data are collected without the user’s permission, the adware is malicious. Such adware is termed spyware and can affect the user’s privacy and security. Malicious adware is installed on a computer via cookies, plug-ins, file sharing, freeware, and shareware. It consumes additional bandwidth and exhausts CPU resources and memory. Attackers perform spyware attacks and collect information from the target user’s hard drive about visited websites or keystrokes in order to misuse the information and conduct fraud. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Indications of Adware</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Frequent system lag</strong>: If the system takes longer than usual to respond, it may have adware infection. Adware also affects the processor speed and consumes memory, degrading performance.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Inundated advertisements:&nbsp;</strong>The user is flooded with unsolicited advertisements and pop-ups in the user interface while browsing. Occasionally, the advertisements can be very challenging to close, paving way to malicious redirections.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Incessant system crash:&nbsp;</strong>The user’s system may crash or freeze constantly, occasionally displaying the blue screen of death (BSoD).<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Disparity in the default browser homepage:&nbsp;</strong>The default browser homepage changes unexpectedly and redirects to malicious pages that contain malware.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Presence of new toolbar or browser add-ons:&nbsp;</strong>The installation of a new toolbar or browser add-on without the user’s consent is an indication of adware.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Slow Internet:&nbsp;</strong>Adware may cause the Internet connection to slow down even in normal usage by downloading huge advertisements and unwanted items in the background. &nbsp;</li></ul></div>
