  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A threat is the potential occurrence of an undesirable event that can eventually damage and disrupt the operational and functional activities of an organization. A threat can be any type of entity or action performed on physical or intangible assets that can disrupt security. The existence of threats may be accidental, intentional, or due to the impact of another action. Attackers use cyber threats to infiltrate and steal data such as personal information, financial information, and login credentials. They can also use a compromised system to perform malicious activities and launch further attacks. The criticality of a threat is based on how much damage it can cause, how uncontrollable it is, or the level of complexity in identifying the latest discovered threat incident in advance. Threats to data assets cause loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability (CIA) of data. They also result in data loss, identity theft, cyber sabotage, and information disclosure.</p><p><strong>Examples of Threats</strong></p><ul><li>An attacker stealing sensitive data of an organization</li><li>An attacker causing a server to shut down</li><li>An attacker tricking an employee into revealing sensitive information</li><li>An attacker infecting a system with malware</li><li>An attacker spoofing the identity of an authorized person to gain access</li><li>An attacker modifying or tampering with the data transferred over a network</li><li>An attacker remotely altering the data in a database server</li><li>An attacker performing URL redirection or URL forwarding</li><li>An attacker performing privilege escalation for unauthorized access</li><li>An attacker executing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks for making resources unavailable</li><li>An attacker eavesdropping on a communication channel without authorized access</li></ul></div>
