  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Viruses are the scourge of modern computing. Computer viruses have the potential to wreak havoc on both business and personal computers. The lifetime of a virus depends on its ability to reproduce itself. Therefore, attackers design every virus code such that the virus replicates itself <em>n</em> times.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A computer virus is a self-replicating program that produces its code by attaching copies of itself to other executable code and operates without the knowledge or consent of the user. Like a biological virus, a computer virus is contagious and can contaminate other files; however, viruses can infect external machines only with the assistance of computer users.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Virus reproduces its own code while enclosing other executables, and spreads throughout the computer. Viruses can spread the infection by damaging files in a file system. Some viruses reside in the memory and may infect programs through the boot sector. A virus can also be in an encrypted form.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Some viruses affect computers as soon as their code is executed; other viruses remain dormant until a pre-determined logical circumstance is met. Viruses infect a variety of files, such as overlay files (.OVL) and executable files (.EXE, .SYS, .COM, or .BAT). They are transmitted through file downloads, infected disk/flash drives, and email attachments.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A virus can only spread from one PC to another when its host program is transmitted to the uncorrupted computer. This can occur, for example, when a user transmits it over a network, or executes it on removable media. Viruses are sometimes confused with worms, which are standalone programs that can spread to other computers without a host. A majority of PCs are now connected to the Internet and to local area networks, which aids in increasing their spread.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Characteristics of Viruses</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The performance of a computer is affected by a virus infection. This infection can lead to data loss, system crash, and file corruption.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the characteristics of a virus are as follows:</p><ul><li>Infects other programs</li><li>Transforms itself</li><li>Encrypts itself</li><li>Alters data</li><li>Corrupts files and programs</li><li>Replicates itself</li></ul></div>
