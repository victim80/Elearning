  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">To infect a system, first, a virus has to enter it. Once the user downloads and installs the virus from any source and in any form, it replicates itself to other programs. Then, the virus can infect the computer in various ways, some of which are listed below:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Downloads</strong>: Attackers incorporate viruses in popular software programs and upload them to websites intended for download. When a user unknowingly downloads this infected software and installs it, the system is infected.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Email attachments</strong>: Attackers usually send virus-infected files as email attachments to spread the virus on the victimâ€™s system. When the victim opens the malicious attachment, the virus automatically infects the system.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pirated software</strong>: Installing cracked versions of software (OS, Adobe, Microsoft Office, etc.) might infect the system as they may contain viruses.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Failing to install security software</strong>: With the increase in security parameters, attackers are designing new viruses. Failing to install the latest antivirus software or regularly update it may expose the computer system to virus attacks.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Updating software</strong>: If patches are not regularly installed when released by vendors, viruses might exploit vulnerabilities, thereby allowing an attacker to access the system.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Browser</strong>: By default, every browser comes with built-in security. An incorrectly configured browser could result in the automatic running of scripts, which may, in turn, allow viruses to enter the system.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Firewall</strong>: Disabling the firewall will compromise the security of network traffic and invite viruses to infect the system.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pop-ups</strong>: When the user clicks any suspicious pop-up by mistake, the virus hidden behind the pop-up enters the system. Whenever the user turns on the system, the installed virus code will run in the background.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Removable media</strong>: When a healthy system is associated with virus-infected removable media (e.g., CD/ DVD, USB drive, card reader), the virus spreads the system.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Network access</strong>: Connecting to an untrusted Wi-Fi network, leaving Bluetooth ON, or permitting a file sharing program that is accessed openly will allow a virus to take over the device.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Backup and restore</strong>: Taking a backup of an infected file and restoring it to a system infects the system again with the same virus.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Malicious online ads</strong>: Attackers post malicious online ads by embedding malicious code in the ads, also known as malvertising. Once users click these ads, their computers get infected.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Social Media</strong>: People tend to click on social media sites, including malicious links shared by their contacts, which can infect their systems.</li></ul></div>
