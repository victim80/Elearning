  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A vulnerability assessment is an in-depth examination of the ability of a system or application, including current security procedures and controls, to withstand exploitation. It scans networks for known security weaknesses, and recognizes, measures, and classifies security vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, and communication channels. It identifies, quantifies, and ranks possible vulnerabilities to threats in a system. Additionally, it assists security professionals in securing the network by identifying security loopholes or vulnerabilities in the current security mechanism before attackers can exploit them.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A vulnerability assessment may be used to:</p><ul><li>Identify weaknesses that could be exploited</li><li>Predict the effectiveness of additional security measures in protecting information resources from attack</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">Typically, vulnerability-scanning tools search network segments for IP-enabled devices and enumerate systems, operating systems, and applications to identify vulnerabilities resulting from vendor negligence, system or network administration activities, or day-to-day activities. Vulnerability-scanning software scans the computer against the Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) index and security bulletins provided by the software vendor.</p><p><strong>Limitations of Vulnerability Assessment</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are some of the limitations of vulnerability assessments:</p><ul><li>Vulnerability-scanning software is limited in its ability to detect vulnerabilities at a given point in time</li><li>Vulnerability-scanning software must be updated when new vulnerabilities are discovered or when improvements are made to the software being used</li><li>Software is only as effective as the maintenance performed on it by the software vendor and by the administrator who uses it</li><li>Vulnerability Assessment does not measure the strength of security controls</li><li>Vulnerability-scanning software itself is not immune to software engineering flaws that might lead to it missing serious vulnerabilities</li><li>Human judgment is needed to analyze the data after scanning and identifying the false positives and false negatives.</li></ul></div>
