  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Vulnerabilities present in a system or network are classified into the following categories:</p><p><strong>Misconfiguration</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Misconfiguration is the most common vulnerability and is mainly caused by human error, which allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system. It may happen intentionally or unintentionally and affects web servers, application platforms, databases, and networks.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are some examples of misconfiguration:</p><ul><li>An application running with debug enabled</li><li>Unnecessary administrative ports that are open for an application</li><li>Running outdated software on the system</li><li>Running unnecessary services on a machine</li><li>Outbound connections to various Internet services</li><li>Using misconfigured SSL certificates or default certificates</li><li>Improperly authenticated external systems</li><li>Incorrect folder permissions</li><li>Default accounts or passwords</li><li>Set up or configuration pages enabled</li><li>Disabling security settings and features</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers can easily detect these misconfigurations using scanning tools and then exploit the backend systems. Therefore, the administrators must change the default configuration of devices and optimize device security.</p><p><strong>Default Installations</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Default installations are usually user-friendly — especially when the device is being used for the first time when the primary concern is the usability of the device rather than the device’s security. In some cases, infected devices may not contain any valuable information, but are connected to networks or systems that have confidential information that would result in a data breach. Failing to change the default settings while deploying the software or hardware allows the attacker to guess the settings to break into the system.</p><p><strong>Buffer Overflows</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Buffer overflows are common software vulnerabilities that happen due to coding errors that allow attackers to gain access to the target system. In a buffer overflow attack, the attackers undermine the functioning of programs and try to take control of the system by writing content beyond the allocated size of the buffer. Insufficient bounds checking in the program is the root cause. The buffer is not able to handle data beyond its limit, causing the flow of data to adjacent memory locations and overwriting their data values. Systems often crash, become unstable, or show erratic program behavior when buffer overflow occurs.</p><p><strong>Unpatched Servers</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Servers are an essential component of the infrastructure of any organization. There are several cases where organizations run unpatched and misconfigured servers that compromise the security and integrity of the data in their system. Hackers look out for these vulnerabilities in the servers and exploit them. As these unpatched servers are a hub for the attackers, they serve as an entry point into the network. This can lead to the exposure of private data, financial loss, and discontinuation of operations. Updating software regularly and maintaining systems properly by patching and fixing bugs can help in mitigating the vulnerabilities caused by unpatched servers.</p><p><strong>Design Flaws</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Vulnerabilities due to design flaws are universal to all operating devices and systems. Design vulnerabilities such as incorrect encryption or the poor validation of data refer to logical flaws in the functionality of the system that attackers exploit to bypass the detection mechanism and acquire access to a secure system.</p><p><strong>Operating System Flaws</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Due to vulnerabilities in the operating systems, applications such as trojans, worms, and viruses pose threats. These attacks use malicious code, script, or unwanted software, which results in the loss of sensitive information and control of computer operations. Timely patching of the OS, installing minimal software applications, and using applications with firewall capabilities are essential steps that an administrator must take to protect the OS from attacks.</p><p><strong>Application Flaws</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Application flaws are vulnerabilities in applications that are exploited by the attackers. Applications should be secured using the validation and authorization of the user. Flawed applications pose security threats such as data tampering and unauthorized access to configuration stores. If the applications are not secured, sensitive information may be lost or corrupted. Hence, developers must understand the anatomy of common security vulnerabilities and develop highly secure applications by providing proper user validation and authorization.</p><p><strong>Open Services</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Open ports and services may lead to the loss of data or DoS attacks and allow attackers to perform further attacks on other connected devices. Administrators must continuously check for unnecessary or insecure ports and services to reduce the risk to the network.</p><p><strong>Default Passwords</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Manufacturers provide users with default passwords to access the device during its initial set-up, which users must change for future use. When users forget to update the passwords and continue using the default passwords, they make devices and systems vulnerable to various attacks, such as brute force and dictionary attacks. Attackers exploit this vulnerability to obtain access to the system. Passwords should be kept confidential; failing to protect the confidentiality of a password allows the system to be easily compromised.</p><p><strong>Zero-Day Vulnerabilities</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Zero-day vulnerabilities are unknown vulnerabilities in software/hardware that are exposed but not yet patched. These are exploited by the attackers before being acknowledged and patched by the software developers or security analysts. Zero-day vulnerabilities are one of the major cyber threats that continuously expose vulnerable systems until they get patched.</p><p><strong>Legacy Platform Vulnerabilities</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Legacy platform vulnerabilities are exposed from old or familiar codes. However, they could cause costly data breaches for organizations. Using these outdated codes, attackers can easily discover zero-day vulnerabilities in the system or software that are not yet patched.</p></div>
