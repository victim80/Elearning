  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A vulnerability refers to a weakness in the design or implementation of a system that can be exploited to compromise the security of the system. It is frequently a security loophole that enables an attacker to enter the system by bypassing user authentication. &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Common Reasons for the Existence of Vulnerabilities</p><p><strong>Hardware or software misconfiguration</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The insecure configuration of the hardware or software in a network can lead to security loopholes. For example, a misconfiguration or the use of an unencrypted protocol may lead to network intrusions, resulting in the leakage of sensitive information. While a misconfiguration of hardware may allow attackers to obtain access to the network or system, a misconfiguration of software may allow attackers to obtain access to applications and data.</p><p><strong>Insecure or poor design of network and application</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">An improper and insecure design of a network may make it susceptible to various threats and potential data loss. For example, if firewalls, IDS, and virtual private network (VPN) technologies are not implemented securely, they can expose the network to numerous threats.</p><p><strong>Inherent technology weaknesses</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">If the hardware or software is not capable of defending the network against certain types of attacks, the network will be vulnerable to those attacks. Certain hardware, applications, or web browsers tend to be prone to attacks such as DoS or man-in-the-middle attacks. For example, systems running old versions of web browsers are prone to distributed attacks. If systems are not updated, a small Trojan attack can force the user to scan and clean the entire storage in the machine, which often leads to data loss.</p><p><strong>End-user carelessness</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">End-user carelessness considerably impacts network security. Human behavior is fairly susceptible to various types of attacks and can be exploited to effect serious outcomes, including data loss and information leakage. Intruders can obtain sensitive information through various social engineering techniques. The sharing of account information or login credentials by users with potentially malicious entities can lead to the loss of data or exploitation of the information. Connecting systems to an insecure network can also lead to attacks from third parties.</p><p><strong>Intentional end-user acts</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ex-employees who continue to have access to shared drives can misuse them by revealing the companyâ€™s sensitive information. Such an act is called an intentional end-user act and can lead to heavy data and financial losses for the company.</p></div>
