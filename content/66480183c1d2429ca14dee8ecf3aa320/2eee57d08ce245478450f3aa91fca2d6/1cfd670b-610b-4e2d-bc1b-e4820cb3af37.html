  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">There are two approaches to network vulnerability scanning:</p><p><strong>Active Scanning</strong>: The attacker interacts directly with the target network to find vulnerabilities. Active scanning helps in simulating an attack on the target network to uncover vulnerabilities that can be exploited by the attacker.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: An attacker sends probes and specially crafted requests to the target host in the network to identify vulnerabilities.</li></ul><p><strong>Passive Scanning</strong>: The attacker tries to find vulnerabilities without directly interacting with the target network. The attacker identifies vulnerabilities via information exposed by systems during normal communications. Passive scanning identifies the active operating systems, applications, and ports throughout the target network, monitoring activity to determine its vulnerabilities. This approach provides information about weaknesses but does not provide a path for directly combating attacks.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: An attacker guesses the operating system information, applications, and application and service versions by observing the TCP connection setup and teardown.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers scan for vulnerabilities using tools such as Nessus, Qualys, GFI LanGuard, and OpenVAS. Vulnerability scanning enables an attacker to identify network vulnerabilities, open ports and running services, application and services configuration errors, and application and service vulnerabilities.</p></div>
