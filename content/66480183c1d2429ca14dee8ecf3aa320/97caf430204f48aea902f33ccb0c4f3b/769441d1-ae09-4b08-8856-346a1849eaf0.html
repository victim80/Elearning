  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Spyware is stealthy computer monitoring software that allows you to secretly record all the user activities on a target computer. It automatically delivers logs to the remote attacker using the Internet (via email, FTP, command and control through encrypted traffic, HTTP, DNS, etc.). The delivery logs include information about all areas of the system, such as emails sent, websites visited, every keystroke (including logins/passwords for Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.), file operations, and online chat conversations. It also takes screenshots at set intervals, just like a surveillance camera aimed at the computer monitor. Spyware is similar to a Trojan horse, which is usually bundled as a hidden component of freeware or software downloaded from the Internet. It hides its process, files, and other objects to avoid detection and removal.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Spyware infects a user’s system when they visit a fraudulent website containing malicious code controlled by the spyware author. This malicious code forcibly downloads and installs spyware on the user’s computer. It may also infect the computer by, for example, manipulating loopholes in the browser/software or binding itself with trusted software. Once spyware is installed, it monitors the user’s activities on the Internet. This allows an attacker to gather information about a victim or organization, such as email addresses, user logins, passwords, credit card numbers, and banking credentials.</p></div>
