  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p class="CEHSub" style="text-align:center;">Figure 3.10: Demonstration of spyware</p><p class="CEHSub" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Spyware Propagation</strong></p><p class="CEHSub" style="text-align:justify;">As its name implies, spyware is installed without user knowledge or consent, and this can be accomplished by “piggybacking” the spyware onto other applications. This is possible because spyware uses advertising cookies, which is one of the spyware subclasses. Spyware can also affect your system when you visit a spyware distribution website. Because it installs itself when you visit and click something on a website, this process is known as “drive-by downloading.”</p><p class="CEHSub" style="text-align:justify;">As a result of normal web surfing or downloading activities, the system may inadvertently become infected with spyware. It can even masquerade as anti-spyware and run on the user’s computer without any notice, whenever the user downloads and installs programs that are bundled with spyware.</p><p class="CEHSub" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What Does the Spyware Do?</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">We have already discussed spyware and its main function of watching user activities on a target computer. We also know that once an attacker succeeds in installing spyware on a victim’s computer using the propagation techniques discussed earlier, they can perform several offensive actions to the victim’s computer. Therefore, let us now learn more about the capabilities of spyware, as we are now aware of its ability to monitor user activities.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The installed spyware can also help the attacker perform the following on target computers:</p><ul><li>Steals users’ personal information and sends it to a remote server or hijacker</li><li>Monitors users’ online activity</li><li>Displays annoying pop-ups</li><li>Redirects a web browser to advertising sites</li><li>Changes the browser’s default setting and prevents the user from restoring it</li><li>Adds several bookmarks to the browser’s favorites list</li><li>Decreases overall system security level</li><li>Reduces system performance and causes software instability</li><li>Connects to remote pornography sites</li><li>Places desktop shortcuts to malicious spyware sites</li><li>Steals your passwords</li><li>Sends you targeted email</li><li>Changes the home page and prevents the user from restoring it</li><li>Modifies the dynamically linked libraries (DLLs) and slows down the browser</li><li>Changes firewall settings</li><li>Monitors and reports websites you visit</li></ul></div>
