Most PUAs originate from sources such as legitimate software packages and even malicious applications used for illegal activities. PUAs can degrade system performance and compromise privacy and data security. Most PUAs get installed when downloading and installing freeware using a third-party installer or when accepting a misleading license agreement. PUAs can covertly monitor and alter the data or settings in the system, similarly to other malware.</p><p><strong>Types of PUAs</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Adware:&nbsp;</strong>These PUAs display unsolicited advertisements offering free sales and pop-ups of online services when browsing websites. They may disturb normal activities and lure victims into clicking on malicious URLs. They may also issue bogus reminders regarding outdated software or OS.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Torrent:&nbsp;</strong>When using torrent applications for downloading large files, the user may be compelled to download unwanted programs that have features of peer-to-peer file sharing.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Marketing:&nbsp;</strong>Marketing PUAs monitor the online activities performed by users and send browser details and information regarding personal interests to third-party app owners. These applications then market products and resources based on users’ personal interests.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cryptomining:&nbsp;</strong>Cryptomining PUAs make use of the victims’ personal assets and financial data on the system and perform the digital mining of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoins.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dialers:&nbsp;</strong>Dialers or spyware dialers are programs that get installed and configured in a system automatically to call a set of contacts at several locations without the user’s consent. Dialers cause massive telephone bills and are sometimes very difficult to locate and delete.</li></ul></div>
