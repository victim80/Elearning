  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:center;">Figure 3.14: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)</p><h4>National Vulnerability Database (NVD)</h4><p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <em>https://nvd.nist.gov</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The NVD is the U.S. government repository of standards-based vulnerability management data. It uses the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). Such data enable the automation of vulnerability management, security measurement, and compliance. The NVD includes databases of security checklist references, security-related software flaws, misconfigurations, product names, and impact metrics.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The NVD performs an analysis on CVEs that have been published to the CVE Dictionary. NVD staff are tasked with the analysis of CVEs by aggregating data points from the description, references supplied, and any supplemental data that are publicly available. This analysis results in association impact metrics (Common Vulnerability Scoring System – CVSS), vulnerability types (Common Weakness Enumeration — CWE), and applicability statements (Common Platform Enumeration — CPE), as well as other pertinent metadata. The NVD does not actively perform vulnerability testing; it relies on vendors, third party security researchers, and vulnerability coordinators to provide information that is used to assign these attributes.</p></div>
