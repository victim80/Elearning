The use of CVE Identifiers, or “CVE IDs,” which are assigned by CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs) from around the world, ensures confidence among parties when discussing or sharing information about a unique software or firmware vulnerability. CVE provides a baseline for tool evaluation and enables data exchange for cybersecurity automation. CVE IDs provide a baseline for evaluating the coverage of tools and services so that users can determine which tools are most effective and appropriate for their organization’s needs. In short, products and services compatible with CVE provide better coverage, easier interoperability, and enhanced security.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">What CVE is:</p><ul><li>One identifier for one vulnerability or exposure</li><li>One standardized description for each vulnerability or exposure</li><li>A dictionary rather than a database</li><li>A method for disparate databases and tools to “speak” the same language</li><li>The way to interoperability and better security coverage</li><li>A basis for evaluation among services, tools, and databases</li><li>Free for the public to download and use</li><li>Industry-endorsed via the CVE Numbering Authorities, CVE Board, and the numerous products and services that include CVE</li></ul></div>
