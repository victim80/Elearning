It is sponsored by the National Cybersecurity FFRDC, which is owned by The MITRE Corporation, with support from US-CERT and the National Cyber Security Division of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The latest version 3.2 of the CWE standard was released in January 2019. It has over 600 categories of weaknesses, which gives CWE the ability to be effectively employed by the community as a baseline for weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. It also has an advanced search technique where attackers can search and view weaknesses based on research concepts, development concepts, and architectural concepts.</p></div>
