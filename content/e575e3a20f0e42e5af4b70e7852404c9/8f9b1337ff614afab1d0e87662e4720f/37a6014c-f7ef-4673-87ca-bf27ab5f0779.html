  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Structured Query Language (SQL) is a textual language used by a database server. SQL commands used to perform operations on the database include <strong>INSERT</strong>, <strong>SELECT</strong>, <strong>UPDATE</strong>, and <strong>DELETE</strong>. These commands are used to manipulate data in the database server.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Programmers use sequential SQL commands with client-supplied parameters, making it easier for attackers to inject commands. SQL injection is a technique used to take advantage of unsanitized input vulnerabilities to pass SQL commands through a web application for execution by a backend database. In this technique, the attacker injects malicious SQL queries into the user input form either to gain unauthorized access to a database or to retrieve information directly from the database. Such attacks are possible because of a flaw in web applications and not because of any issue with the database or the web server.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">SQL injection attacks use a series of malicious SQL queries or SQL statements to manipulate the database directly. An application often uses SQL statements to authenticate users to the application, validate roles and access levels, store and obtain information for the application and user, and link to other data sources. SQL injection attacks work because the application does not properly validate an input before passing it to an SQL statement.</p></div>
