It is an extension of SOAP and aims to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of SOAP messages as well as to authenticate users.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">There are other important features/components of the web service architecture, such as WS-Work Processes, WS-Policy, and WS Security Policy, which play an important role in communication between applications.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Characteristics of Web Services</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>XML-based</strong>: Web services use XML for data representation and transportation. XML usage can avoid OS, networking, or platform binding. Applications that provide web services are highly interoperable.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Coarse-grained service</strong>: In web services, some objects contain a massive amount of information and offer greater functionality than fine-grained services. A coarse-grained service is a combination of multiple fine-grained services.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Loosely coupled</strong>: Web services support a loosely coupled approach for interconnecting systems. The interaction between the systems can occur via the web API by sending XML messages. The web API incorporates a layer of abstraction for the infrastructure to make the connection flexible and adaptable.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Asynchronous and synchronous support</strong>: Synchronous services are called by users who wait for a response, whereas asynchronous services are called by users who do not wait for a response. RPC-based messages and document-based messages are often used for synchronous and asynchronous web services. &nbsp;Synchronous and asynchronous endpoints are implemented using servlets, SOAP/XML, and HTTP.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>RPC support</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Web services support remote procedure calls (RPC) similarly to traditional applications.</li></ul></div>
