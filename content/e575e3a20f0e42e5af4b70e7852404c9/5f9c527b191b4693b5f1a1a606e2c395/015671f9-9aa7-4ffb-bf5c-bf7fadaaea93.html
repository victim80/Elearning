  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Blind SQL Injection is used when a web application is vulnerable to an SQL injection but the results of the injection are not visible to the attacker. Blind SQL injection is identical to a normal SQL Injection except that when an attacker attempts to exploit an application, he/she sees a generic custom page instead of a useful error message. In blind SQL injection, an attacker poses a true or false question to the database to determine whether the application is vulnerable to SQL injection.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A normal SQL injection attack is often possible when the developer uses generic error messages whenever an error has occurred in the database. Such generic messages may reveal sensitive information or give a path to the attacker to perform an SQL injection attack on the application. However, when developers turn off the generic error message for the application, it is difficult for the attacker to perform an SQL injection attack. Nevertheless, it is not impossible to exploit such an application with an SQL injection attack. Blind injection differs from normal SQL injection in the manner of retrieving data from the database. Attackers use blind SQL injection either to access sensitive data or to destroy data. Attackers can steal data by asking a series of true or false questions through SQL statements. The results of the injection are not visible to the attacker. This type of attack can become time-intensive because the database should generate a new statement for each newly recovered bit.</p></div>
