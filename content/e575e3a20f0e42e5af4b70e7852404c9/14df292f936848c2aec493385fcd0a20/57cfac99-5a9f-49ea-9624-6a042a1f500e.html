  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">An attacker attempts to exploit weaknesses to hack well-chosen passwords. The most common passwords found are password, root, administrator, admin, demo, test, guest, qwerty, pet names, and so on.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The attacker mainly targets the following through web server password cracking:</p><ul><li>SMTP and FTP servers</li><li>Web shares</li><li>SSH tunnels</li><li>Web form authentication</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers use different methods such as social engineering, spoofing, phishing, a Trojan horse or virus, wiretapping, and keystroke logging to perform web server password cracking. In many hacking attempts, the attacker starts with password cracking to prove to the web server that they are a valid user.</p><p><strong>Web Server Password Cracking Techniques</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Password cracking is the most common method of gaining unauthorized access to a web server by exploiting flawed and weak authentication mechanisms. Once the password is cracked, an attacker can use the password to launch further attacks.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">We present some details of various tools and techniques used by attackers to crack passwords. Attackers can use password cracking techniques to extract passwords from web servers, FTP servers, SMTP servers, and so on. They can crack passwords either manually or with automated tools such as THC Hydra, Ncrack, and RainbowCrack. The following are some techniques attackers use to crack passwords:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Guessing: </strong>This is the most common method of cracking passwords. In this method, the attacker guesses possible passwords either manually or by using automated tools provided with dictionaries. Most people tend to use their pets’ names, loved ones’ names, license plate numbers, dates of birth, or other weak passwords such as “QWERTY,” “password,” “admin,” etc. so that they can remember them easily. The attacker exploits this human behavior to crack passwords.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Dictionary attack:</strong> A dictionary attack uses a predefined file containing various combinations of words, and an automated program enters these words one at a time to check if any of them are the password. This might not be effective if the password includes special characters and symbols. If the password is a simple word, then it can be found quickly. Compared to a brute-force attack, a dictionary attack is less time-consuming.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Brute-force attack:</strong> In the brute-force method, all possible character combinations are tested; for example, the test may include combinations of uppercase characters from A to Z, numbers from 0 to 9, and lowercase characters from a to z. This method is useful for identifying one-word or two-word passwords. If a password consists of uppercase and lowercase letters as well as special characters, it might take months or years to crack the password using a brute-force attack.</li><li><strong>Hybrid attack: </strong>A hybrid attack is more powerful than the above techniques because it uses both a dictionary attack and brute-force attack. It also uses symbols and numbers. Password cracking is easier with this method than with the above methods.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">The attacker can also use automated tools such as Hashcat, THC Hydra, and Ncrack to crack web passwords and hashes.</p><p><strong>THC Hydra</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <em>https://github.com</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;">THC Hydra is a parallelized login cracker that can attack numerous protocols. This tool is a proof-of-concept code that provides researchers and security consultants the possibility to demonstrate how easy it would be to gain unauthorized remote access to a system.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Currently, this tool supports the following protocols: Asterisk; Apple Filing Protocol (AFP); Cisco Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA); Cisco auth; Cisco enable; Concurrent Versions System (CVS); Firebird; FTP; HTTP-FORM-GET; HTTP-FORM-POST; HTTP-GET; HTTP-HEAD; HTTP-POST; HTTP-PROXY; HTTPS-FORM-GET; HTTPS-FORM-POST; HTTPS-GET; HTTPS-HEAD; HTTPS-POST; HTTP-Proxy; ICQ; Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP); Internet Relay Chat (IRC); Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP); Memcached; MongoDB; Microsoft SQL Server; MySQL; Network Control Protocol (NCP); Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP); Oracle Listener; Oracle system identifier (SID); Oracle; PC-Anywhere; personal computer Network File System (PC-NFS); POP3; Postgres; Radmin; Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP); Rexec; Rlogin; Rsh; Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP); SAP R/3; Session Initiation Protocol (SIP); Server Message Block (SMB); Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP); SMTP Enum; Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) v1+v2+v3; SOCKS5; SSH (v1 and v2); SSH key; Subversion; TeamSpeak (TS2); Telnet; VMware-Auth; Virtual Network Computing (VNC); and Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).</p></div>
