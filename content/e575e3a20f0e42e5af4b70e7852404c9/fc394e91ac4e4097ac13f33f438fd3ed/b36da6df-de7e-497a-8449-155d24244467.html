  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Web applications are software programs that run on web browsers and act as the interface between users and web servers through web pages. They enable the users to request, submit, and retrieve data to/from a database over the Internet by interacting through a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). Users can input data via a keyboard, mouse, or touch interface depending on the device they are using to access the web application. Based on browser-supported programming languages such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, web applications work in combination with other programming languages such as SQL to access data from the databases.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Web applications are developed as dynamic web pages, and they allow users to communicate with servers using server-side scripts. They allow users to perform specific tasks such as searching, sending emails, connecting with friends, online shopping, and tracking and tracing. Furthermore, there are several desktop applications that provide users with the flexibility to work with the Internet.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Entities develop various web applications to offer their services to users via the Internet. Whenever users need to access such services, they can request them by submitting the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) or Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the web application in a browser. The browser passes this request to the server, which stores the web application data and displays it in the browser. Some popular web servers are Microsoft IIS, Apache HTTP Server, H2O, LiteSpeed, etc.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Increasing Internet usage and expanding online businesses have accelerated the development and ubiquity of web applications across the globe. A key factor in the adoption of web applications for business purposes is the multitude of features that they offer. Moreover, they are secure and relatively easy to develop. In addition, they offer better services than many computer-based software applications and are easy to install, maintain, and update.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The advantages of web applications are listed below:</p><ul><li>As they are independent of the operating system, their development and troubleshooting are easy and cost-effective.</li><li>They are accessible anytime and anywhere using a computer with an Internet connection.</li><li>The user interface is customizable, making it easy to update.</li><li>Users can access them on any device having an Internet browser, including PDAs, smartphones, etc.</li><li>Dedicated servers, monitored and managed by experienced server administrators, store all the web application data, allowing developers to increase their workload capacity.</li><li>Multiple locations of servers not only increase physical security but also reduce the burden of monitoring thousands of desktops using the program.</li><li>They use flexible core technologies, such as JSP, Servlets, Active Server Pages, SQL Server, .NET, and scripting languages, which are scalable and support even portable platforms.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">Although web applications enforce certain security policies, they are vulnerable to various attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and session hijacking.</p></div>
