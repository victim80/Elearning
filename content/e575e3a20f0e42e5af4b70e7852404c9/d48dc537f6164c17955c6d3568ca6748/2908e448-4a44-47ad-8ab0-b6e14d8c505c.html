  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Authentication and session management includes every aspect of user authentication and management of active sessions. At present, web applications implementing solid authentications fail because of weak credential functions such as “change my password,” “forgot my password,” “remember my password,” “account update,” and so on. Therefore, developers must take the utmost care to implement user authentication securely. It is always better to use strong authentication methods through special software- and hardware-based cryptographic tokens or biometrics. An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the authentication or session management functions such as exposed accounts, session IDs, logout, password management, timeouts, remember me, secret question, account update, and others to impersonate users.</p><h4>Session ID in URLs</h4><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">A web application creates a session ID for the respective login when a user logs into <em>http://certifiedhackershop.com</em>. An attacker uses a sniffer to sniff the cookie that contains the session ID or tricks the user into getting the session ID. The attacker now enters the following URL in his browser’s address bar:</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><em>http://certifiedhackershop.com/sale/saleitems=304;jsessionid=12OMTOIDPXM0OQSABGCKLHCJUN2JV?dest=NewMexico</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;">This redirects him to the already logged in page of the victim. The attacker successfully impersonates the victim.</p><h4><strong>Password Exploitation</strong></h4><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers can identify passwords stored in databases because of weak hashing algorithms. Attackers can gain access to the web application's password database if user passwords are not encrypted, which allows the attacker to exploit every user’s password.</p><h4><strong>Timeout Exploitation</strong></h4><p style="text-align:justify;">If an application’s session timeouts are set to longer durations, the sessions will last until the time specified, i.e., the session will be valid for a longer period. When the user closes the browser without logging out from sites accessed through a public computer, the attacker can use the same browser later to conduct the attack, as sessions IDs can remain valid; thus, they can exploit the user's privileges.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>:</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A user logs in to <em>www.certifiedhacker.com</em> using his/her credentials. After performing certain tasks, he/she closes the web browser without logging out of the page. The web application’s session timeout is set to two hours. During the specified session interval, if an attacker has physical access to the user’s system, he may then launch the browser, check the history, and click the <em>www.certifiedhacker.com</em> link, which automatically redirects him to the user’s account without the need to enter the user’s credentials.</p></div>
