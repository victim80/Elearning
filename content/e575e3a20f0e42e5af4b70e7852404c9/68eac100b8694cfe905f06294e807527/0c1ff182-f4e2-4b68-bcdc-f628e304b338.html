  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">To defend against SQL injection, the developer needs to take proper care in configuring and developing an application to create one that is robust and secure. The developer should use the best practices and countermeasures to prevent applications from becoming vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Some countermeasures to defend against SQL injection attacks are listed below:</p><ul><li>Make no assumptions about the size, type, or content of the data that is received by your application</li><li>Test the size and data type of the input and enforce appropriate limits to prevent buffer overruns</li><li>Test the content of string variables and accept only expected values</li><li>Reject entries that contain binary data, escape sequences, and comment characters</li><li>Never build Transact-SQL statements directly from user input and use stored procedures to validate user input</li><li>Implement multiple layers of validation and never concatenate user input that is not validated</li><li>Avoid constructing dynamic SQL with concatenated input values</li><li>Ensure that the web config files for each application do not contain sensitive information</li><li>Use the most restrictive SQL account types for applications</li><li>Use network, host, and application intrusion detection systems to monitor injection attacks</li><li>Perform automated black box injection testing, static source code analysis, and manual penetration testing to probe for vulnerabilities</li><li>Keep untrusted data separate from commands and queries</li><li>In the absence of parameterized API, use specific escape syntax for the interpreter to eliminate special characters</li><li>Use a secure hash algorithm such as SHA256 to store user passwords rather than plaintext</li><li>Use the data access abstraction layer to enforce secure data access across an entire application</li><li>Ensure that the code tracing and debug messages are removed prior to deploying an application</li><li>Design the code such that it traps and handles exceptions appropriately</li><li>Apply least privilege rules to run the applications that access the DBMS</li><li>Validate user-supplied data as well as data obtained from untrusted sources on the server side</li><li>Avoid quoted/delimited identifiers as they significantly complicate all whitelisting, black-listing, and escaping efforts</li><li>Use a prepared statement to create a parameterized query to block the execution of the query</li><li>Ensure that all user inputs are sanitized before using them in dynamic SQL statements</li><li>Use regular expressions and stored procedures to detect potentially harmful code</li></ul></div>
