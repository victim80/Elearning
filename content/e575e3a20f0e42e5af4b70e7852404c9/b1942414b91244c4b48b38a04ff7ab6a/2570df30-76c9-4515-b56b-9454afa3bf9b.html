In this attack, the attacker uses different communication channels (such as database email functionality or file writing and loading functions) to perform the attack and obtain the results. Attackers use this technique instead of in-band or blind SQL injection if they are unable to use the same channel through which the requests are being made to launch the attack and gather the results.</p></div></div>
