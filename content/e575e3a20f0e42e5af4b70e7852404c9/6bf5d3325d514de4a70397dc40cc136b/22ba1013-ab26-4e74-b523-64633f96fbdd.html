  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Web applications need to store sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, account records, or other authentication information in a database or on a filesystem. If users do not maintain proper security of their storage locations, then the application may be at risk, as attackers can access the storage and misuse the information.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Many web applications do not protect their sensitive data properly from unauthorized users. Web applications use cryptographic algorithms to encrypt their data and other sensitive information that they need to transfer from the server to the client or vice versa. Sensitive data exposure occurs due to flaws such as insecure cryptographic storage and information leakage.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Even though the data is encrypted, some cryptographic encryption methods have inherent weaknesses allowing attackers to exploit and steal the data. When an application uses poorly written encryption code to encrypt and store sensitive data in the database, the attacker can easily exploit this flaw and steal or modify weakly protected sensitive data such as credit cards numbers, SSNs, and other authentication credentials. Thus, they can launch further attacks such as identity theft and credit card fraud.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Developers can avoid such attacks using proper algorithms to encrypt sensitive data. At the same time, developers must take care to store the cryptographic keys securely. If these keys are stored at insecure locations, then attackers can retrieve them easily and decrypt the sensitive data. Insecure storage of keys, certificates, and passwords also allows the attacker to gain access to the web application as a legitimate user. Sensitive data exposure can cause severe losses to a company. Hence, organizations must protect all their sources such as systems or other network resources from information leakage by employing proper content-filtering mechanisms.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The screenshots below show poorly encrypted vulnerable code and secure code that is properly encrypted using a secure cryptographic algorithm.</p></div>
