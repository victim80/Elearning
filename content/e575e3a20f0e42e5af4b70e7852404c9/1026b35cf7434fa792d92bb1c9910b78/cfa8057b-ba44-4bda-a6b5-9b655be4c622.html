<div class="eg-content-editor" data-type="textEditorOneColumn" style="width: 100%;"><div class="column" style="display: inline-block; width: 100%; vertical-align: top;"><p><strong>End-of-Line Comment</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">In this type of SQL injection, an attacker uses line comments in specific SQL injection inputs. Comments in a line of code are often denoted by (--), and they are ignored by the query. An attacker takes advantage of this commenting feature by writing a line of code that ends in a comment. The database will execute the code until it reaches the commented portion, after which it will ignore the rest of the query.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For example,</p><p><strong>SELECT * FROM members WHERE username = 'admin'--' AND password = 'password' &nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">With this query, an attacker can login to an admin account without the password, as the database application will ignore the comments that begin immediately after username = ‘admin’.</p></div></div>
