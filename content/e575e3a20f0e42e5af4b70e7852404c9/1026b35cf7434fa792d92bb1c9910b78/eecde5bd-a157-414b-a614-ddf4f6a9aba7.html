<div class="eg-content-editor" data-type="textEditorOneColumn" style="width: 100%;"><div class="column" style="display: inline-block; width: 100%; vertical-align: top;"><p><strong>Piggybacked Query</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">In a piggybacked SQL injection attack, an attacker injects an additional malicious query into the original query. This type of injection is generally performed on batched SQL queries. The original query remains unmodified, and the attacker’s query is piggybacked on the original query. Owing to piggybacking, the DBMS receives multiple SQL queries. Attackers use a semicolon (;) as a query delimiter to separate the queries. After executing the original query, the DBMS recognizes the delimiter and then executes the piggybacked query. This type of attack is also known as a stacked queries attack. The intention of the attacker is to extract, add, modify, or delete data, execute remote commands, or perform a DoS attack.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For example, the original SQL query is as follows:</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE EMP.EID = 1001 AND EMP.ENAME = ’Bob’</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Now, the attacker concatenates the delimiter (;) and the malicious query to the original query as follows:</p><p><strong>SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE EMP.EID = 1001 AND EMP.ENAME = ’Bob’; DROP TABLE DEPT;</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">After executing the first query and returning the resultant database rows, the DBMS recognizes the delimiter and executes the injected malicious query. Consequently, the DBMS drops the table DEPT from the database.</p></div></div>
