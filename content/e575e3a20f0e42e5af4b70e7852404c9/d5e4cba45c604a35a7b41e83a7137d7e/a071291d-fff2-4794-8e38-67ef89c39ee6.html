  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Injection flaws are web application vulnerabilities that allow untrusted data to be interpreted and executed as part of a command or query. Attackers exploit injection flaws by constructing malicious commands or queries that result in data loss or corruption, lack of accountability, or denial of access. Such flaws are prevalent in legacy code and often found in SQL, LDAP, and XPath queries. They can be easily discovered by application vulnerability scanners and fuzzers.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers inject malicious code, commands, or scripts in the input gates of flawed web applications such that the applications interpret and run the newly supplied malicious input, which in turn allows them to extract sensitive information. By exploiting injection flaws in web applications, attackers can easily read, write, delete, and update any data (i.e., relevant or irrelevant to that particular application). There are many types of injection flaws, some of which are discussed below:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SQL Injection</strong>: SQL injection is the most common website vulnerability on the Internet, and it is used to take advantage of non-validated input vulnerabilities to pass SQL commands through a web application for execution by a backend database. In this technique, the attacker injects malicious SQL queries into the user input form either to gain unauthorized access to a database or to retrieve information directly from the database.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Command Injection</strong>: Attackers identify an input validation flaw in an application and exploit the vulnerability by injecting a malicious command in the application to execute supplied arbitrary commands on the host operating system. Thus, such flaws are extremely dangerous.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LDAP Injection</strong>: LDAP injection is an attack method in which websites that construct LDAP statements from user-supplied input are exploited for launching attacks. When an application fails to sanitize the user input, the attacker modifies the LDAP statement with the help of a local proxy. This, in turn, results in the execution of arbitrary commands such as granting access to unauthorized queries and altering the content inside the LDAP tree.</li></ul></div>
