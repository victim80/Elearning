  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:center;">Figure 7.21: Vulnerability Stack</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers exploit the vulnerabilities of one or more elements among the seven levels to gain unrestricted access to an application or the entire network.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Layer 7:&nbsp;</strong>If an attacker finds vulnerabilities in the business logic (implemented using languages such as .NET and Java), he/she can exploit these vulnerabilities by performing input validation attacks such as XSS.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Layer 6:&nbsp;</strong>Third-party components are services that integrate with the website to achieve certain functionality (e.g., Amazon.com targeted by an attacker is the main website; citrix.com is a third-party website).</p><p style="text-align:justify;">When customers choose a product to buy, they click on the Buy/Checkout button. This redirects them to their online banking account through a payment gateway. Third-party websites such as citrix.com offer such payment gateways. Attackers might exploit such redirection and use it as a medium/pathway to enter Amazon.com and exploit it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Layer 5:&nbsp;</strong>Web servers are software programs that host websites. When users access a website, they send a URL request to the web server. The server parses this request and responds with a web page that appears in the browser. Attackers can perform footprinting on a web server that hosts the target website and grab banners that contain information such as the web server name and its version. They can also use tools such as Nmap to gather such information. Then, they might start searching for published vulnerabilities in the CVE database for that particular web server or service version number and exploit any that they find.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Layer 4:&nbsp;</strong>Databases store sensitive user information such as user IDs, passwords, phone numbers, and other particulars. There could be vulnerabilities in the database of the target website. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers using tools such as sqlmap to gain control of the targetâ€™s database.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Layer 3:&nbsp;</strong>Attackers scan an operating system to find open ports and vulnerabilities, and they develop viruses/backdoors to exploit them. They send malware through the open ports to the target machine; by running such malware, they can compromise the machine and gain control over it. Later, they try to access the databases of the target website.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Layer 2:&nbsp;</strong>Routers/switches route network traffic only to specific machines. Attackers flood these switches with numerous requests that exhaust the CAM table, causing it to behave like a hub. Then, they focus on the target website by sniffing data (in the network), which can include credentials or other personal information.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Layer 1:&nbsp;</strong>IDS and IPS raise alarms if any malicious traffic enters a target machine or server. Attackers adopt evasion techniques to circumvent such systems so that they do not trigger any alarm while exploiting the target.</p></div>
