  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Access control refers to how a web application grants access to create, update, and delete any record/content or function to some privileged users while restricting access to other users. Broken access control is a method in which an attacker identifies a flaw related to access control, bypasses the authentication, and then compromises the network. Access control weaknesses are common due to the lack of automated detection and effective functional testing by application developers. They allow attackers to act as users or administrators with privileged functions and create, access, update, or delete any record.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">According to the OWASP 2017 R2 revision, broken access control is a combination of insecure direct object reference and missing function level access control.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Insecure Direct Object References</strong>: When developers expose various internal implementation objects such as files, directories, database records, or key-through references, the result is an insecure direct object reference. For example, if a bank account number is a primary key, there is a chance of the application being compromised by attackers who take advantage of such references.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Missing Function Level Access Control</strong>: In some web applications, function level protection is managed via configuration, and attackers exploit these function level access control flaws to access unauthorized functionality. The main targets of the attackers in this scenario are the administrative functions. Developers must include proper code checks to prevent such attacks. Detecting such flaws is easy for an attacker; however, identifying the vulnerable functions or web pages (URLs) to attack is considerably difficult.</li></ul></div>
