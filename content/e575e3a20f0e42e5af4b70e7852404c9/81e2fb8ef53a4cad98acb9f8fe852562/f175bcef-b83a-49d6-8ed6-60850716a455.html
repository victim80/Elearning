  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Powerful server-side technologies such as ASP.NET and database servers allow developers to create dynamic, data-driven websites and web applications with incredible ease. These technologies implement business logic on the server side, which then serves incoming requests from clients. The server-side technology smoothly accesses, delivers, stores, and restores information. Various server-side technologies include ASP, ASP.Net, Cold Fusion, JSP, PHP, Python, Ruby on Rails, and so on. Some of these technologies are prone to SQL injection vulnerabilities, and applications developed using these technologies are vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Web applications use various database technologies as part of their functionality. Some relational databases used for developing web applications include Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, IBM DB2, and the open-source MySQL. Developers sometimes unknowingly ignore secure coding practices when using these technologies, which makes the applications and relational databases vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. These attacks do not exploit a specific softwareâ€™s vulnerability; instead, they target websites and web applications that do not follow secure coding practices to access and manipulate the data stored in a relational database.</p></div>
