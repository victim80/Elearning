It is difficult to identify and remove XSS flaws from web applications. The best way to find flaws is to perform a security review of the code and search in all the places where the input from an HTTP request comes as an output through HTML.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Attacker uses a variety of HTML tags to transmit a malicious JavaScript. Nessus, Nikto, and other tools can help to some extent in scanning websites for these flaws. If the scanning discovers a vulnerability in a website, it is highly likely to be vulnerable to other attacks.</li></ul></div></div>
