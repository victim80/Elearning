  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">There are inherent security risks associated with web servers, the local area networks (LANs) that host websites, and the end users who access these websites using browsers.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Webmaster’s perspective</strong>: From a webmaster’s perspective, the greatest security concern is that a web server can expose the LAN or corporate intranet to threats posed by the Internet. These threats may be in the form of viruses, Trojans, attackers, or the compromise of data. Bugs in software programs are often sources of security lapses. Web servers, which are large and complex devices, also have these inherent risks. In addition, the open architecture of web servers allows arbitrary scripts to run on the server side while responding to remote requests. Any Common Gateway Interface (CGI) script installed in the web server may contain bugs that are potential security holes.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Network administrator’s perspective</strong>: From a network administrator’s perspective, a poorly configured web server causes potential holes in the LAN’s security. While the objective of the web server is to provide controlled access to the network, excess control can make the web almost impossible to use. In an intranet environment, the network administrator must configure the web server carefully so that legitimate users are recognized and authenticated, and groups of users are assigned distinct access privileges.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>End user’s perspective</strong>: Usually, the end user does not perceive any immediate threat, because surfing the web appears both safe and anonymous. However, active content, such as ActiveX controls and Java applets, make it possible for harmful applications, such as viruses, to invade the user’s system. In addition, active content from a website that is displayed by the user’s browser can be used as a conduit for malicious software to bypass the firewall system and permeate the LAN.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are some oversights that can compromise a web server:</p><ul><li>Improper file and directory permissions</li><li>Installing the server with default settings</li><li>Unnecessary services enabled, including content management and remote administration</li><li>Security conflicts with the business’ ease-of-use requirements</li><li>Lack of proper security policy, procedures, and maintenance</li><li>Improper authentication with external systems</li><li>Default accounts with default or no passwords</li><li>Unnecessary default, backup, or sample files</li><li>Misconfigurations in the web server, OS, and networks</li><li>Bugs in server software, OS, and web applications</li><li>Misconfigured Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates and encryption settings</li><li>Administrative or debugging functions that are enabled or accessible on web servers</li><li>Use of self-signed certificates and default certificates</li></ul></div>
