  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:center;">Figure 7.2: Conceptual diagram of a web server: the user visits websites hosted on a web server</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Organizations can defend most network-level and OS-level attacks by adopting network security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDSs), and intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) and by following security standards and guidelines. This forces attackers to turn their attention to web-server- and web-application-level attacks because a web server that hosts web applications is accessible from anywhere over the Internet. This makes web servers an attractive target. Poorly conﬁgured web servers can create vulnerabilities in even the most carefully designed ﬁrewall systems. Attackers can exploit poorly configured web servers with known vulnerabilities to compromise the security of web applications. Furthermore, web servers with known vulnerabilities can harm the security of an organization. As shown in below figure, organizational security includes seven levels from stack 1 to stack 7.</p></div>
