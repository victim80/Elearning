  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A web server is a hardware/software application that hosts websites and makes them accessible over the Internet. A web server, along with a browser, successfully implements clientâ€“server model architecture. In this model, the web server plays the role of the server, and the browser acts as the client. To host websites, a web server stores the web pages of websites and delivers a particular web page upon request. Each web server has a domain name and an IP address associated with that domain name. A web server can host more than one website. Any computer can act as a web server if it has specific server software (a web server program) installed and is connected to the Internet.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Web servers are chosen based on their capability to handle server-side programming, security characteristics, publishing, search engines, and site-building tools. Apache, Microsoft IIS, Nginx, Google, and Tomcat are some of the most widely used web server software. An attacker usually targets vulnerabilities in the software component and configuration errors to compromise web servers.</p></div>
