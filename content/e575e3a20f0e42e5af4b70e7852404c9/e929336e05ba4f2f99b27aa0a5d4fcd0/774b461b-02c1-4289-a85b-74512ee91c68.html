  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers exploit server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities, which evolve from the unsafe use of functions in an application, in public web servers to send crafted requests to the internal or backend servers. Internal servers are usually implemented by firewalls to prevent the network from unwanted traffic inflows. Therefore, attackers leverage SSRF vulnerabilities in Internet-facing web servers to gain access to the backend servers that are protected by a firewall. The backend server believes that the request is made by the web server because they are on the same network and responds with the data stored in it.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Generally, server-side requests are initiated to obtain information from an external resource and feed it into an application. For instance, a designer can utilize a URL such as <em>https://xyz.com/feed.php?url=externalsite.com/feed/to</em> to obtain a remote feed. If attackers can alter the URL input to the localhost, then they can view all the local resources on the server. This is how SSRF vulnerabilities evolve.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Once the attack is successfully performed, attackers can perform various activities such as port scanning, network scanning, IP address discovery, reading of web server files, bypassing of host-based authentication, interaction with critical protocols, and remote code execution.</p></div>
