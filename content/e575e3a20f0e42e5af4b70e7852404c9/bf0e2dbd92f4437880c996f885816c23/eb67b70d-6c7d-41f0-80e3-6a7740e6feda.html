  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Web applications maintain logs to track usage patterns, such as user login credentials and admin login credentials. Insufficient logging and monitoring refer to scenarios in which the detection software either does not record the malicious event or ignores the important details about the event. Attackers usually inject, delete, or tamper with the web application logs to engage in malicious activities or hide their identities. Due to insufficient logging and monitoring, the detection of malicious attempts of the attacker becomes more difficult and the attacker can perform malicious attacks, such as password brute-forcing, to steal confidential passwords.</p></div>
