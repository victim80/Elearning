  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Developers and network administrators should ensure that an entire application stack is configured properly; otherwise, security misconfiguration can occur at any level of the stack, including its platform, web server, application server, framework, and custom code. For instance, if the developer does not configure the server properly, it could result in various problems that can affect the site security. Problems that lead to such instances include unvalidated inputs, parameter/form tampering, improper error handling, insufficient transport layer protection, etc.</p><p><strong>Unvalidated Inputs</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Input validation flaws refer to a web application vulnerability whereby input from a client is not validated before being processed by web applications and backend servers. No validation or improper validation can make a web application vulnerable to various input validation attacks. If web applications implement input validation only on the client side, attackers can easily bypass it by tampering with the HTTP requests, URLs, headers, form fields, hidden fields, and query strings. Usersâ€™ login IDs and other related data are stored in the cookies, which become a means of attack. An attacker exploits input validation flaws to perform cross-site scripting, buffer overflow, injection attacks, etc., resulting in data theft and system malfunction.</p></div>
