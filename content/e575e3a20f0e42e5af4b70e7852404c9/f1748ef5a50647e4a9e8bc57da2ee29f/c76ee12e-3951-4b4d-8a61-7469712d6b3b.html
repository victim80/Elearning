  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">An XML External Entity attack is a Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack whereby an application can parse XML input from an unreliable source because of the misconfigured XML parser. In this attack, an attacker sends a malicious XML input containing a reference to an external entity to the victim's web application. When this malicious input is processed by a weakly configured XML parser of the target web application, it enables the attacker to access protected files and services from servers or connected networks.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Since XML features are widely available, the attacker abuses these features to create documents or files dynamically at the time of processing. Attackers tend to make the most of this attack, as it allows them to retrieve confidential data, perform DoS attacks, and obtain sensitive information via HTTP(S); in some worst-case scenarios, they may even be able to perform remote code execution or launch a CSRF attack on any vulnerable service.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">According to the XML 1.0 standard, XML uses entities often defined as storage units. Entities are special features of XML that can access local or remote contents, and they are defined anywhere in a system via system identifiers. The entities need not be part of an XML document, as they can come from an external system as well. The system identifiers that act as a URI are used by the XML processor while processing the entity. The XML parsing process replaces these entities with their actual data, and here, the attacker exploits this vulnerability by forcing the XML parser to access the file or the contents specified by him/her. This attack may be more dangerous as a trusted application; processing of XML documents can be abused by the attacker to pivot the internal system to acquire all sorts of internal data of the system.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For example, the attacker sends the following code to extract the system data from the vulnerable target.</p></div>
