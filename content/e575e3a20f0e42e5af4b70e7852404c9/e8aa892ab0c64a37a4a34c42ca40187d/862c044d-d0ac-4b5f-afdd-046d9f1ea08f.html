In-band attacks are commonly used and easy-to-exploit SQL injection attacks. The most commonly used in-band SQL injection attacks are error-based SQL injection and UNION SQL injection.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Blind/Inferential SQL Injection</strong>: In blind/inferential injection, the attacker has no error messages from the system to work on. Instead, the attacker simply sends a malicious SQL query to the database. This type of SQL injection takes a longer time to execute because the result returned is generally in Boolean form. Attackers use true or false results to determine the structure of the database and the data. In the case of inferential SQL injection, no data is transmitted through the web application, and it is not possible for an attacker to retrieve the actual result of the injection; therefore, it is called blind SQL injection.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Out-of-Band SQL Injection</strong>: Attackers use different communication channels (such as database email functionality or file writing and loading functions) to perform the attack and obtain the results. This type of attack is difficult to perform because the attacker needs to communicate with the server and determine the features of the database server used by the web application.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">The diagram below shows the different types of SQL injection:</p></div>
