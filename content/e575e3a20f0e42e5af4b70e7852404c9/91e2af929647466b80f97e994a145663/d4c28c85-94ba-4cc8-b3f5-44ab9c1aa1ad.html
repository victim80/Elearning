  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">An HTTP response-splitting attack is a web-based attack in which the attacker tricks the server by injecting new lines into response headers, along with arbitrary code. It involves adding header response data into the input field so that the server splits the response into two responses. This type of attack exploits vulnerabilities in input validation. Cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and Structured Query Language (SQL) injection are examples of this type of attack. In this attack, the attacker controls the input parameter and cleverly constructs a request header that elicits two responses from the server. The attacker alters a single request to appear as two requests by adding header response data into the input field. The web server, in turn, responds to each request. The attacker can pass malicious data to a vulnerable application, and the application includes the data in an HTTP response header. The attacker can control the first response to redirect the user to a malicious website, whereas the web browser will discard other responses.</p></div>
