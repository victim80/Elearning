  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A web server consists of the following components:</p><p><strong>Document Root</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The document root is one of the root file directories of the web server that stores critical HTML files related to the web pages of a domain name, which will be sent in response to requests.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For example, if the requested URL is <em>www.certifiedhacker.com</em> and the document root is named “certroot” and is stored in the directory <em>/admin/web</em>, then <em>/admin/web/certroot</em> is the document directory address.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">If the complete request is <em>www.certifiedhacker.com/P-folio/index.html</em>, the server will search for the file path <em>/admin/web/certroot/P-folio/index.html</em>.</p><p><strong>Server Root</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">It is the top-level root directory under the directory tree in which the server’s configuration and error, executable, and log files are stored. It consists of the code that implements the server. The server root, in general, consists of four files. One file is dedicated to the code that implements the server, while the other three are subdirectories, namely, -conf, -logs, and -cgi-bin, which are used for configuration information, logs, and executables, respectively.</p><p><strong>Virtual Document Tree</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">A virtual document tree provides storage on a different machine or disk after the original disk becomes full. It is case-sensitive and can be used to provide object-level security.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In the above example under document root, for a request of <em>www.certifiedhacker.com/P-folio/index.html</em>, the server can also search for the file path <em>/admin/web/certroot/P-folio/index.html</em> if the directory <em>admin/web/certroot</em> is stored in another disk.</p><p><strong>Virtual Hosting</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">It is a technique of hosting multiple domains or websites on the same server. This technique allows the sharing of resources among various servers. It is employed in large-scale companies, in which company resources are intended to be accessed and managed globally.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are the types of virtual hosting:</p><ul><li>Name-based hosting</li><li>Internet Protocol (IP)-based hosting</li><li>Port-based hosting</li></ul><p><strong>Web Proxy</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">A proxy server is located between the web client and web server. Owing to the placement of web proxies, all requests from clients are passed on to the web server through the web proxies. They are used to prevent IP blocking and maintain anonymity.</p></div>
