Such attacks occur when invalidated input data is included in dynamic content that is sent to a user's web browser for rendering. Attackers inject malicious JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX, HTML, or Flash for execution on a victim's system by hiding it within legitimate requests. Attackers bypass client-ID security mechanisms, gain access privileges, and then inject malicious scripts into specific web pages. These malicious scripts can even rewrite HTML website content.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Some exploitations that can be performed by XSS attacks are as follows:</p></div><div class="WordSection2"><ul><li>Malicious script execution</li><li>Redirecting to a malicious server</li><li>Exploiting user privileges</li><li>Ads in hidden IFRAMES and pop-ups</li><li>Data manipulation</li><li>Session hijacking</li><li>Brute-force password cracking</li><li>Data theft&nbsp;</li><li>Intranet probing</li><li>Keylogging and remote monitoring</li></ul></div><p><strong>How XSS Attacks Work</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">A web page consists of text and HTML markup created by the server and obtained by the client browser. Servers can control the client's interpretation about the statically generated pages, but they cannot completely control the client's interpretation of the output of the page generated dynamically by the servers. Thus, if the attacker inserts untrusted content into a dynamic page, neither the server nor the client recognizes it. Untrusted input can come from URL parameters, form elements, cookies, database queries, and so on.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">If the dynamic data inserted by the web server contains special characters, the user's web browser will mistake them for HTML markup, as it treats some characters as special to distinguish text from markup. Thus, an attacker can choose the data inserted into the generated page and mislead the user's browser into running the attackerâ€™s script. As the malicious scripts will execute in the browser's security context for communicating with the legitimate web server, the attacker will have complete access to the document retrieved and may send the data in the page back to his/her site.</p></div>
