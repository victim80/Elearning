  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Web applications run on web browsers and use a set of server-side scripts (Java, C#, Ruby, PHP, etc.) and client-side scripts (HTML, JavaScript, etc.) to execute the application. The working of the web application depends on its architecture, which includes hardware and software that perform tasks such as reading the request as well as searching, gathering, and displaying the required data.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The web application architecture includes different devices, web browsers, and external web services that work with different scripting languages to execute the web application. It consists of three layers:</p><ol><li>Client or presentation layer</li><li>Business logic layer</li><li>Database layer</li></ol><p style="text-align:justify;">The client or presentation layer includes all physical devices present on the client side, such as laptops, smartphones, and computers. These devices feature operating systems and compatible browsers, which enable users to send requests for required web applications. The user requests a website by entering a URL in the browser, and the request travels to the web server. The web server then responds to the request and fetches the requested data; the application finally displays this response in the browser in the form of a web page.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The “business logic” layer itself consists of two layers: the web-server logic layer and the business logic layer. The web-server logic layer contains various components such as a firewall, an HTTP request parser, a proxy caching server, an authentication and login handler, a resource handler, and a hardware component, e.g., a server. The firewall offers security to the content, the HTTP request parser handles requests coming from clients and forwards responses to them, and the resource handler is capable of handling multiple requests simultaneously. The web-server logic layer contains code that reads data from the browser and returns the results (e.g., IIS Web Server, Apache Web Server).</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The business logic layer includes the functional logic of the web application, which is implemented using technologies such as .NET, Java, and “middleware”. It defines the flow of data, according to which the developer builds the application using programming languages. It stores the application data and integrates legacy applications with the latest functionality of the application. The server needs a specific protocol to access user-requested data from its database. This layer contains the software and defines the steps to search and fetch the data.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The database layer consists of cloud services, a B2B layer that holds all the commercial transactions, and a database server that supplies an organization’s production data in a structured form (e.g., MS SQL Server, MySQL server).</p></div>
