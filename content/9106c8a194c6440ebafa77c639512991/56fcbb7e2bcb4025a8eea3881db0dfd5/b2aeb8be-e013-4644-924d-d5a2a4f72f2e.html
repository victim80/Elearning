  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Most smart vehicles use smart locking systems, which include an RF signal transmitted in the form of code from a modern key fob to lock or unlock the vehicle. Here, the code sent to the vehicle is only used once and is different for every other use, which means if a vehicle receives the same code again, it rejects it.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The code that locks or unlocks a car or garage is called a rolling code or hopping code. It is used in a keyless entry system to prevent replay attacks. An eavesdropper can capture the code transmitted and later use it to unlock the garage or vehicle.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">To obtain the rolling code, the attacker thwarts the transmission of a signal from the key fob to the receiver in the vehicle. This attack is performed using a jamming device that simultaneously jams the signal and sniffs the code, and the attacker later uses that code to unlock the vehicle or the garage door.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For example, given below are the steps followed by an attacker to perform a rolling-code attack:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Victim presses car remote button and tries to unlock the car</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Attacker uses a jammer that jams the carâ€™s reception of the rolling code sent by the victim and simultaneously sniffs the first code</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The car does not unlock; victim tries again by sending a second code</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Attacker sniffs the second code</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On the second attempt by the victim, the attacker forwards the first code, which unlocks the car</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The recorded second code is used later by the attacker to unlock and steal the vehicle</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers can make use of tools such as rfcat-rolljam and RFCrack to perform this attack.</p></div>
