  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">IoT technology is growing so quickly that it has become ubiquitous. With numerous applications and features but a lack of basic security policies, IoT devices are currently easy prey for hackers. In addition, upgrades to IoT devices have introduced new security flaws that can be easily exploited by hackers. To overcome this significant issue, manufacturing companies should consider security as the top priority, starting with planning and design, and up to deployment, implementation, management, and maintenance.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Discussed below are some of the challenges facing IoT devices that make them vulnerable to threats:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lack of Security and Privac</strong><strong>y</strong>: Most IoT devices today, such as household devices, industrial devices, healthcare devices, automobiles, etc., are connected to the Internet and contain important and confidential data. These devices lack even basic security and privacy policies, and hackers can exploit this to carry out malicious activity.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Vulnerable Web Interfaces</strong>: Many IoT devices come with embedded web server technology that makes them vulnerable to attacks.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Legal, Regulatory, and Rights Issu</strong>e: Due to the interconnection of IoT devices, certain security issues are raised with no existing laws that address these issues.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Default, Weak, and Hardcoded Credentials</strong>: One of the most common reasons for cyber-attacks on IoT devices is their authentication systems. These devices usually come with default and weak credentials, which can easily be exploited by a hacker to gain unauthorized access to the devices.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Clear Text Protocols and Unnecessary Open Ports</strong>: IoT devices lack encryption techniques during the transmission of data, which at times causes them to use certain protocols that transmit data in clear text in addition to having open ports.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Coding Errors (Buffer Overflow)</strong>: Most IoT devices today have embedded web services that are subject to the same vulnerabilities that are commonly exploited on web service platforms. As a result, updating such functionality may give rise to issues like buffer overflows, SQL injection, etc. within technology infrastructure.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Storage Issues</strong>: IoT devices generally come with smaller data storage capacity, but the data collected and transmitted by the devices is limitless. Therefore, this gives rise to data storage, management, and protection issues.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Difficult-to-Update Firmware and OS</strong>: Upgrading firmware is an essential step toward countering vulnerabilities in a device, but it may impair a deviceâ€™s functionality. For this reason, developers or manufacturers may hesitate or even refuse to provide product support or make adjustments during the development phase of their products.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Interoperability Standard Issues</strong>: One of the biggest obstacles for IoT devices is the interoperability issue, which is key to the viability and long-term growth of the entire IoT ecosystem. The issues that arise due to lack of interoperability in IoT devices are the inability of manufacturers to test application programming interfaces (APIs) using common methods and mechanisms, their inability to secure devices using software from third parties, and their inability to manage and monitor devices using a common layer.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Physical Theft and Tampering</strong>: Physical attacks on IoT devices include tampering with the devices to inject malicious code or files to make the devices work the way the attacker intends, or making hardware modifications to the devices. Counterfeiting the devices may also be an issue when proper physical protection is not present to shield the devices.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lack of Vendor Support for Fixing Vulnerabilities</strong>: The firmware of the devices has to be upgraded in order to protect the devices against certain vulnerabilities, but vendors are hesitant, or they usually refuse to get third-party access to their devices.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Emerging Economy and Development Issues</strong>: With widespread opportunities for IoT devices in every field, multiple layers of complexity are added for policymakers. The new landscape introduced by these devices adds a new dimension for the policymakers, who have to design new blueprints and policies for IoT devices.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Handling of Unstructured Data</strong>: An increase in the number of connected devices will increase the complexity of handling unstructured data as its volume, velocity, and variety increases. It is important for organizations to understand and determine which data is valuable and actionable.</li></ul></div>
