  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">The IoT includes different technologies such as embedded sensors, microprocessors, and power management devices. Security consideration changes from device to device and application to application. The greater the amount of confidential data we send across the network, the greater the risk of data theft, data manipulation, data tampering, and attacks on routers and servers.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Improper security infrastructure might lead to the following unwanted scenarios:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">An eavesdropper intercepts communication between two endpoints and discovers the confidential information that is sent across. He/she can misuse that information for his/her own benefit.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A fake server can be used to send unwanted commands to trigger unplanned events. For example, some physical resources (water, coal, oil, electricity) could be sent to an unknown and unplanned destination, etc.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A fake device can inject a malicious script into the system to make it work as instructed by the device. This may cause the system to behave inappropriately and dangerously.</li></ul></div>
