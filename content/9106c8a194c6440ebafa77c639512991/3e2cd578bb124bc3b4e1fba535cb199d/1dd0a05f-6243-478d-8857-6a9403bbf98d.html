  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Discussed below are some of the most important and extensively used terms related to OT systems:</p><p><strong>Assets</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Different components of OT are generally referred to as assets. Most OT systems, such as ICSs, comprise physical assets such as sensors and actuators, servers, workstations, network devices, PLCs, etc. ICS systems also include logical assets that represent the workings and containment of physical assets, such as graphics representing process flow, program logic, database, firmware, or firewall rules.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Zones and Conduits</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Zones and conduits is a network segregation technique used to isolate networks and assets to impose and maintain strong access control mechanisms.</p><p><strong>Industrial Network and Business Network</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">OT generally comprises a collection of automated control systems. These systems are networked to achieve a business objective. A network comprising these systems is known as an industrial network. An enterprise or business network comprises a network of systems that offer an information infrastructure to the business. Businesses often need to establish communications between business networks and industrial networks.</p><p><strong>Industrial Protocols</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Most OT systems employ proprietary protocols (S7, CDA, SRTP, etc.) or non-proprietary protocols (Modbus, OPC, DNP3, CIP, etc.). These protocols are generally used for serial communication and can also be used for communication over standard Ethernet using Internet Protocol (IP) along with transport layer protocols TCP or UDP. As these protocols operate at the application layer, they are referred to as applications.</p><p><strong>Network Perimeter/Electronic Security Perimeter</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The network perimeter is the outermost boundary of a network zone, i.e., a closed group of assets. It acts as a point of separation between the interior and exterior of a zone. Generally, cybersecurity controls are implemented at the network perimeter. An Electronic Security Perimeter refers to a boundary between secure and insecure zones.</p><p><strong>Critical Infrastructure</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Critical infrastructure refers to a collection of physical or logical systems and assets, the failure or destruction of which will severely impact security, safety, the economy, or public health.&nbsp;</p></div>
