  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">IT/OT convergence is the integration of IT (information technology) computing systems and OT operation monitoring systems. Bridging the gap between IT and OT can improve the overall business, producing faster and efficient results. IT/OT convergence is not just about combining technologies but also about teams and operations. IT and OT teams are traditionally separated and are found in their respective domains. For instance, IT teams monitor internal processes such as programming, updating systems, and safeguarding networks from cyber-attacks, whereas OT teams ensure overall maintenance and management, including that of employees and industrial equipment.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">IT/OT teams are required to understand each otherâ€™s operations and working structure. This does not mean switching IT engineers into field/plant engineers or vice versa; it is about building a bridge between them to co-operate with each other to improve security, efficiency, quality, and productivity.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Benefits of merging OT with IT</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">IT/OT convergence can enable smart manufacturing known as industry 4.0, in which IoT applications are used in industrial operations. Using the IoT for industrial operations such as monitoring supply-chain, manufacturing, and management systems is referred to as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are some of the benefits of converging IT/OT:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Enhancing Decision Making</strong>: Decision making can be enhanced by integrating OT data into business intelligence solutions.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Enhancing Automation</strong>: Business flow and industrial control operations can be optimized by OT/IT merging; together they can improve the automation.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Expedite Business Output</strong>: IT/OT convergence can organize or streamline development projects to accelerate business output.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Minimizing Expenses</strong>: Reduces the technological and organizational overheads.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mitigating Risks</strong>: Merging these two fields can improve overall productivity, security, and reliability, as well as ensuring scalability.</li></ul></div>
