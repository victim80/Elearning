  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is an attack in which multiple infected systems are used to bombard a single online system or service, rendering the server useless, slow, or unavailable for a legitimate user for a short period of time. The attacker initiates the attack by first exploiting vulnerabilities in devices and then installing malicious software in their operating systems. These multiple compromised devices are referred to as an army of botnets.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Once an attacker decides on his/her target, he/she instructs the botnets or zombie agents to send requests to the target server that he/she is attacking. The target is attacked by a large volume of requests from multiple IoT devices present in different locations. As a result, the target system is flooded with more requests than it can handle. Therefore, it either goes offline, suffers a loss in performance, or shuts down completely.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Given below are the steps followed by an attacker to perform a DDoS attack on IoT devices:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Attacker gains remote access to vulnerable devices</li><li style="text-align: justify;">After gaining access, he/she injects malware into the IoT devices to turn them into botnets</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Attacker uses a command and control center to instruct botnets and to send multiple requests to the target server, resulting in a DDoS attack</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Target server goes offline and becomes unavailable to process any further requests</li></ul></div>
