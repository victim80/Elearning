  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">IoT technology includes four primary systems: IoT devices, gateway systems, data storage systems using cloud technology, and remote control using mobile apps. These systems together make communication between two endpoints possible.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Discussed below are some of the important components of IoT technology that play an essential role in the function of an IoT device:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sensing Technology</strong>: Sensors embedded in the devices sense a wide variety of information from their surroundings, including temperature, gases, location, workings of some industrial machinery, or health data of a patient.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>IoT Gateways</strong>: Gateways are used to bridge the gap between an IoT device (internal network) and the end-user (external network), thus allowing them to connect and communicate with each other. The data collected by the sensors in the IoT device is sent to the connected user or cloud through the gateway.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Cloud Server/Data Storage</strong>: After traveling through the gateway, the collected data arrives at the cloud, where it is stored and undergoes data analysis. The processed data is then transmitted to the user, who can take certain actions based on the information received.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Remote Control using Mobile App</strong>: The end-user uses remote controls such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, etc. installed with a mobile app to monitor, control, retrieve data, and take a specific action on IoT devices from a remote location.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>:</p><ol><li style="text-align:justify;">A smart security system installed in a home will be integrated with a gateway, which in turn helps to connect the device to the Internet and the cloud infrastructure.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Data stored in a cloud includes information about every device connected to the network. This information includes the device’s ID and the present status of the device, as well as information regarding who has accessed the device and how many times. It also includes information such as how long the device was accessed for previously.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">The connection with the cloud server is established through web services.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">The user on the other side, who has the required app to access the device remotely on his/her mobile phone, interacts with it, which in turn allows him/her to interact with the device at home. Before accessing the device, he/she is asked to authenticate him/herself. If the credentials submitted by him/her match those saved in the cloud, he/she is granted access. Otherwise, his/her access is denied, ensuring security. The cloud server identifies the device’s ID and sends a request associated with that device using gateways.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">The security system that is currently recording the footage at home, if it senses any unusual activity, then sends an alert to the cloud through the gateway, which matches the device’s ID and the user associated with it, and finally, the end-user receives an alert.</li></ol></div>
