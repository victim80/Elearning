  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">OT plays a vital role in several sectors of critical infrastructure, like power plants, water utilities, and healthcare. Absurdly, most OT systems run on old versions of software and use obsolete hardware, which makes them vulnerable to malicious exploits like phishing, spying, ransomware attacks, etc. These types of attacks can be devastating to products and services. To curb these vulnerabilities, the OT system must employ critical examination in key areas of vulnerability by using various security tools and tactics.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Discussed below are some of the challenges and risks to OT that makes it vulnerable to many threats:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Lack of visibility</strong>: Broader cybersecurity visibility in the OT network achieves greater security and so one can rapidly respond to any potential threats. However, most organizations do not have clear cybersecurity visibility, making it difficult for the security teams to detect unusual behaviors and signatures.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Plain-text passwords</strong>: Most industrial site networks use either weak or plain-text passwords. Plain-text passwords lead to weak authentication, which in turn leaves the systems vulnerable to various cyber-reconnaissance attacks.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Network complexity</strong>: Most OT network environments are complex due to comprising numerous devices, each of which has different security needs and requirements.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Legacy technology</strong>: OT systems generally use older technologies without appropriate security measures like encryption and password protection, leaving them vulnerable to various attacks. Applying modern security practices is also a challenge.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Lack of antivirus protection</strong>: Industries using legacy technology and outdated systems are not provided with any antivirus protection, which can update signatures automatically, thus making them vulnerable to malware infections.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Lack of skilled security professionals</strong>: The cybersecurity skills gap poses a great threat to organizations, as there is a lack of skilled security professionals to discover threats and implement new security controls and defenses in networks.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Rapid pace of change</strong>: Maintaining the pace of change is the biggest challenge in the field of security, and slow digital transformation can also compromise OT systems.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Outdated systems</strong>: Most OT devices, such as PLCs, use outdated firmware, making them vulnerable to many modern cyberattacks.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Haphazard modernization</strong>: As the demand for OT grows, it must stay up to date with the latest technologies. However, due to the use of legacy components in OT system upgrading and patching, updating the system can take several years, which can adversely affect several operations.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Insecure connections</strong>: OT systems communicate over public Wi-Fi and unencrypted Wi-Fi connections in the IT network for transferring control data, making them susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Usage of rogue devices</strong>: Many industrial sites have unknown or rogue devices connected to their networks, which are vulnerable to various attacks.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Convergence with IT</strong>: OT mostly connects with the corporate network; as a result, it is vulnerable to various malware attacks and malicious insiders. In addition, the OT systems are IT enabled, and the IT security team does not have much experience with the OT systems and protocols.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Organizational challenges</strong>: Many organizations implement and maintain different security architectures that meet the needs of both IT and OT. This can create some flaws in security management, leaving ways for the attackers to intrude into the systems easily.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Unique production networks/proprietary software</strong>: Industries follow unique hardware and software configurations that are dependent on industry standards and explicit operational demands. The use of proprietary software makes it difficult to update and patch firmware, as multiple vendors control it.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Vulnerable communication protocols</strong>: OT uses communication protocols such as Modbus and Profinet for supervising, controlling, and connecting different mechanisms such as controllers, actuators, and sensors. These protocols lack in-built security features such as authentication, detection of flaws, or detection of abnormal behavior, making them vulnerable to various attacks.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Remote management protocols</strong>: Industrial sites use remote management protocols such as RDP, VNC, and SSH. Once the attacker compromises and gains access to the OT network, he/she can perform further exploitation to understand and manipulate the configuration and working of the equipment.</li></ul></div>
