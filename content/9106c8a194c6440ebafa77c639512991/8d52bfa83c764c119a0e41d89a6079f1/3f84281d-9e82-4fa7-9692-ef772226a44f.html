  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Software-defined radio (SDR) is a method of generating radio communications and implementing signal processing using software (or firmware), instead of the usual method of using hardware. Using this software-based radio communication system (self-created SDRs), an attacker can examine the communication signals in IoT networks and send spam content or texts to interconnected devices. The SDR system can also change the transmission and reception of signals between devices, depending on their software implementations. The attack can be carried out on both full-duplex (two-way communication) and half-duplex (one-way communication) transmission modes.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Types of SDR-based attacks performed by attackers to break into an IoT environment:</p><p><strong>Replay Attack</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">This is the major attack described in IoT threats, in which attackers can capture the command sequence from connected devices and use it for later retransmission.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">An attacker can perform the below steps to launch a replay attack:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Attacker targets the specified frequency that is required to share information between devices</li><li style="text-align:justify;">After obtaining the frequency, the attacker can capture the original data when the commands are initiated by the connected devices</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Once the original data is collected, the attacker uses free tools such as URH (Universal Radio Hacker) to segregate the command sequence</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Attacker then injects the segregated command sequence on the same frequency into the IoT network, which replays the commands or captured signals of the devices</li></ul><p><strong>Cryptanalysis Attack</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">A cryptanalysis attack is another type of substantial attack on IoT devices. In this attack, the procedure used by the attacker is the same as in a replay attack except for one additional step, i.e., reverse-engineering the protocol to obtain the original signal. To accomplish this task, the attacker must be skilled in cryptography, communication theory, and modulation scheme (to remove noises from the signal). This attack is practically not as easy as a replay attack to launch, yet the attacker can try to breach security using various tools and procedures.</p><p><strong>Reconnaissance Attack</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">This is an addition to a cryptanalysis attack. In this attack, information can be obtained from the device’s specifications. All IoT devices that run through RF signals must be certified by their country’s authority, and then they officially disclose an analysis report of the device. Designers often prevent this kind of analysis by obscuring any identification marks from the chipset. Therefore, the attacker makes use of multimeters to investigate the chipset and mark out some identifications, such as ground pins, to discover the product ID and compare it with the published report.</p></div>
