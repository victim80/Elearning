  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Jamming is a type of attack in which the communications between wireless IoT devices are jammed in order to compromise them. During this attack, an overwhelming volume of malicious traffic is sent, which results in a DoS attack to authorized users, thus obstructing legitimate traffic and making the endpoints unable to communicate with each other. Every wireless device and the wireless network are prone to this attack.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers use special types of hardware and transmit radio signals randomly with the frequency at which the target device is communicating. The signals or the traffic generated by the jamming device appear as noise to wireless devices, which causes them to withhold their transmissions until the noise subsides. This results in a DoS attack that jams the network, and devices are unable to send or receive any data.</p></div>
