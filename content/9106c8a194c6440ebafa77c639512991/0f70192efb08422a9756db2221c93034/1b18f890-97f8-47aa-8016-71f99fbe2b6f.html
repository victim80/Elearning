  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Fault injection attacks, also known as perturbation attacks, occur when a perpetrator injects a faulty or malicious program into a system to compromise the system security. These faulty programs can be induced using various attack techniques. Fault injection attacks can be both invasive and non-invasive in nature.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In non-invasive attacks, the attacker should be available very near to the chip to tamper with the default program or data and gather sensitive information. In an invasive attack, the chip surface should be visible to the attacker and can be operated physically.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Discussed below are different types of fault injection attack:</p><p><strong>Optical, Electromagnetic Fault Injection (EMFI), Body Bias Injection (BBI)</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The main objective of these attacks is to inject faults into devices by projecting lasers and electromagnetic pulses that are used in analog blocks such as random number generators (RNGs) and for applying high-voltage pulses. These faults are then used by the attackers in compromising the system security.</p><p><strong>Power/Clock/Reset Glitching</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">These types of attacks occur when faults or glitches are injected into the power supply that can be used for remote execution, also causing the skipping of key instructions. Faults can also be injected into the clock network used for delivering a synchronized signal across the chip.</p><p><strong>Frequency/Voltage Tampering</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">In these attacks, the attackers try to tamper with the operating conditions of a chip, and they can also modify the level of the power supply and alter the clock frequency of the chip. The intention of the attackers is to introduce fault behavior into the chip to compromise the device security.</p><p><strong>Temperature Attacks</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers alter the temperature for operating the chip, thereby changing the whole operating environment. This attack can be operated in non-nominal conditions.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">After injecting faults using various techniques, now attackers can exploit the fault behavior of the device to perform various attacks to steal sensitive information or interrupt the normal operation of the device.</p></div>
