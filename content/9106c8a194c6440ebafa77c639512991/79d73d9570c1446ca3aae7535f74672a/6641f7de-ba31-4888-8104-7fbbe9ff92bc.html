  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers gather basic information about the target organization using various social engineering techniques. After obtaining information such as the email IDs of employees, an attacker sends phishing emails to the employees with a malicious attachment (e.g., a Word document). When an employee of the target organization opens the email and clicks on the attachment, a backdoor is automatically installed in the target system. Using the backdoor, the attacker gains access to the private network of the organization. For example, consider an attack on a power grid. In such an attack, after gaining access to the private network, an attacker can access the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) network that controls the grid. After gaining access to the SCADA network, the attacker replaces the legitimate firmware with malicious firmware to process commands sent by the attacker. Finally, the attacker can disable the power supply to any particular place by sending malicious commands to the substation control systems from the SCADA network.</p></div>
