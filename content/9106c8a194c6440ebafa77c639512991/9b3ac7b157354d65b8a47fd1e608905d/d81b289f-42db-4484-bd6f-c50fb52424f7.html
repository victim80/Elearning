  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Many organizations use Internet-connected heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems without implementing security mechanisms, giving attackers a gateway through which to hack corporate systems. HVAC systems have many security vulnerabilities that are exploited by attackers to steal login credentials, gain access to the HVAC system, and perform further attacks on the organizationâ€™s network. HVAC systems are generally connected to the networks of various industries, government sectors, hospitals, etc. These systems provide remote access rights to HVAC vendors and third parties to support their remote administration, such as remotely monitoring energy consumption and temperatures in various places. In addition, many HVAC companies provide common login names and passwords to different organizations. Attackers take advantage of this to obtain remote access to corporate networks and steal confidential information from organizations.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Steps followed by an attacker to exploit HVAC systems:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Attacker uses <strong>Shodan&nbsp;</strong>(<em>https://www.shodan.io</em>) and searches for vulnerable industrial control systems (ICSs)</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Based on the vulnerable ICSs found, the attacker then searches for default user credentials using online tools such as <em>https://www.defpass.com</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;">Attacker uses default user credentials to attempt to access the ICS</li><li style="text-align: justify;">After gaining access to the ICS, the attacker attempts to gain access to the HVAC system remotely through the ICS</li><li style="text-align: justify;">After gaining access to the HVAC system, an attacker can control the temperature from the HVAC or carry out other attacks on the local network</li></ul></div>
