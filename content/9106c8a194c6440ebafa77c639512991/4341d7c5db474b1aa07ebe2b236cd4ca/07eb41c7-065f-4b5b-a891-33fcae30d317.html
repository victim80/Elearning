  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">The Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved from the convergence of wireless technology, micro-electromechanical systems, micro-services, and the Internet. IoT has introduced a range of new technologies with associated capabilities into our daily lives. As it is an evolving field, the immaturity of technologies and services provided by various vendors will have a broad impact on organizations, leading to complex security issues. IoT security is difficult to ensure as the devices use simple processors and stripped-down operating systems that may not support sophisticated security approaches. Organizations using these devices as part of their network need to protect both the devices and the information from attackers.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Industrial companies are digitizing their industrial facilities to enhance operational efficiency through Internet connectivity and remote data access; in this scenario, they increasingly need to focus on cybersecurity to mitigate new threats and safety issues arising from the convergence of operational technology and information technology (OTâ€“IT). Organizations need to understand the landscape of cyber threats, industrial infrastructure, and business. Before implementing cybersecurity policies and controls, organizations need to identify and prioritize the key risks and threats that will have the greatest impact on their business.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The main objective of this module is to explain the potential threats to IoT and OT platforms and to provide guidelines for securing IoT devices and OT infrastructure from evolving threats and attacks.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">At the end of this module, you will be able to do the following:</p><ul><li>Explain IoT concepts</li><li>Understand different IoT threats and attacks</li><li>Use different IoT attack tools</li><li>Apply countermeasures to protect devices from IoT attacks</li><li>Use different IoT security tools</li><li>Explain OT concepts</li><li>Understand different OT threats and attacks</li><li>Use different OT attack tools</li><li>Apply countermeasures to protect industrial facilities from OT attacks</li><li>Use different OT security tools</li></ul></div>
