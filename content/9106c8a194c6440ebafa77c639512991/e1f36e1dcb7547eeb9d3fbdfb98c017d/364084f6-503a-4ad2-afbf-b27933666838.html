  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Most industrial machines are operated via remote controllers. These remote controllers are used in various industries, such as manufacturing, logistics, mining, and construction, for automation or to control machines. Devices in a network use a transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) to communicate with each other. While the transmitter (TX) passes radio commands (via buttons), the receiver (TX) reacts to the corresponding commands. Improper security implementations in devices operating via remote controllers can pose severe security risks to industrial systems.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers can stand within the radius of the target system and use a specially designed radio transceiver-type device. The device helps attackers to design their own packets and send them in a network to gain access over the industrial system and perform various malicious activities.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Listed below are threats industrial systems often face via RF remote controllers:</p><p><strong>Replay Attack</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Attackers record the commands (RF packets) transmitted by an operator and replay them to the target system to gain basic control over the system.</p></div>
