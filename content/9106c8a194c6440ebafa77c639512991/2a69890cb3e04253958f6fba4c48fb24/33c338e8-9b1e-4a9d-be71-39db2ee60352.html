  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">OT is a combination of software and hardware designed to detect or cause changes in industrial operations through direct monitoring and/or controlling of industrial physical devices. These devices include switches, pumps, lights, sensors, surveillance cameras, elevators, robots, valves, and cooling and heating systems. Any system that analyzes and processes operational data (such as technical components, electronics, telecommunications, and computer systems) can be a part of OT.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">OT systems are used in the manufacturing, mining, healthcare, building, transportation, oil and gas, defense, and utility sectors, as well as many other industries, to ensure the safety of physical devices and their operations in networks. This technology consists of Industrial Control Systems (ICSs), which include Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), Remote Terminal Units (RTU), Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), Distributed Control Systems (DCSs), and many other dedicated network systems that help in monitoring and controlling industrial operations.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">OT systems employ different approaches to design hardware and protocols that are unfamiliar with IT. Supporting older versions of software and hardware makes OT systems more vulnerable to cyber-attacks, as developing fixes or patches for them is very difficult.</p></div>
