  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Penetration assessment can be performed using the following approaches.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Goal-oriented/objective-oriented penetration testing</strong> <strong>approach</strong>: Goals are the drivers for this penetration testing approach. In this type of assessment, a pen tester tasked with identifying or demonstrating a risk attempts to achieve a goal, rather than find vulnerabilities. They focus on finding different ways to achieve the goal. In goal-oriented penetration assessment, the goal is defined before the start of pen testing. To achieve the set goals (objective), the pen tester performs multiple serial or parallel processes. Some common goals in goal-oriented/objective-oriented penetration testing are as follows:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Gain remote access to an internal network</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Gain access to credit-card information</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Gain domain administrator access</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Create a denial of service (DoS) condition against a website</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Deface a website</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Compliance-oriented penetration testing approach</strong>: Compliance requirements are the drivers for this approach. It entails testing against adherence to compliance requirements. It involves conducting assessments against the compliance requirements of cyber-security standards, frameworks, laws, acts, etc. For example, an organization may ask to perform a security assessment against compliance standards such as PCI-DSS, ISO-27001, FISMA, HIPAA, and HITRUST. Compliance-oriented penetration testing also reviews firewall rules for compliance.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The compliance-oriented penetration testing approach is a proactive approach to secure and maintain compliance. This enables organizations to do the following:</p><ul><li>Maintain the security posture of the organization by identifying and preventing attacks before they occur</li><li>Enhance the security infrastructure or policy framework</li><li>Evaluate an organization’s compliance level in specific areas such as patch management, password policy, and configuration management</li><li>Protect client data from breaches, which could result in a heavy penalty</li><li>Verify the system’s security with respect to certification and accreditation (C&amp;A) activities</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Red-team-oriented penetration testing approach:&nbsp;</strong>This approach is an adversarial goal-based assessment in which the pen tester must mimic a real attacker and target an environment. This approach has no specific driver. For example, an organization may ask to conduct a security assessment for evaluating its overall security. It may include the assessment of people, networks, applications, physical security, etc. Furthermore, it is an offensive type of security testing in which a red team works with a blue team and updates the blue team with the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the read team.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">It enables organizations to do the following:</p><ul><li>Understand their ability to detect and respond to real-world attacks</li><li>Assess their organizational security with respect to specific targets</li><li>Verify their organizational response to an attack</li><li>Validate elements of organizational security postures</li><li>Identify risks missed by the penetration testing team</li></ul></div>
