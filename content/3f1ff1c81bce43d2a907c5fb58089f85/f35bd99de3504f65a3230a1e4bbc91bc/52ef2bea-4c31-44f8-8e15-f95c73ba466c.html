  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">The three types of penetration testing are black-, white-, and gray-box testing. Each test type takes a different approach for assessing the security of an organizationâ€™s infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Black-box testing</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">To simulate real-world attacks and minimize false positives, penetration testers can choose to undertake black-box testing (or zero-knowledge attack, with no information or assistance from the client) and map the network while enumerating services, shared file systems, and operating systems (OSes) discreetly.</p><p><strong>White-box testing</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">If the organization needs to assess its security against a specific kind of attack or a specific target, complete information about the same may be given to pen testers. The information provided can include network topology documents, asset inventory, and valuation information. An organization typically opts for white-box testing when it requires a complete audit of its security. Regardless, it is critical to note that information security is an ongoing process, and penetration testing only provides a snapshot of the security posture of an organization at any given point in time.</p><p><strong>Gray-box testing</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Gray-box penetration testing, the most common approach toward application security, tests the vulnerabilities an attacker can find and exploit. This testing process functions in a manner similar to black-box testing. Both the attacking team and a normal user of the application are provided with the same privileges, and the purpose is to simulate an attack performed by a malicious insider.</p></div>
