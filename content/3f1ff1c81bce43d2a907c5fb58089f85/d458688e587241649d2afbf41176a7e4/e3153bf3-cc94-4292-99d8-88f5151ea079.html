  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">There are three phases in penetration testing: the pre-attack, attack, and post-attack phases.</p><p><strong>Pre-attack Phase</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">This phase focuses on gathering as much information as possible about the target. Information can be gathered invasively through, for example, passive and active reconnaissance, port scanning, service scanning, and OS scanning, or it can be gathered noninvasively by, for example, reviewing public records.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Beginning with passive and active reconnaissance, the tester gathers as much information as possible about the target company. Most leaked information is related to the network topology and types of services running within. The tester can use this information to provisionally map out the network for planning a more coordinated attack strategy.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Passive reconnaissance involves the following:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Mapping the directory structure of the web servers and FTP servers.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Gathering competitive intelligence.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Determining the value of infrastructure interfacing with the web.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Retrieving network registration information from WHOIS databases and financial websites.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Determining the product range and service offerings of the target company that are available online or can be requested offline.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Document sifting, which refers to gathering information solely from published material.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Social engineering can be performed by identifying a conduit (a person who can be targeted easily based on the information gained about personnel) and profiling them.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">In active reconnaissance, the information-gathering process encroaches on the target territory. Here, the perpetrator may send probes to the target in the form of port scans, network sweeps, enumeration of shares and user accounts, and so on. The tester may adopt techniques such as social engineering and use tools that automate these tasks such as scanners and sniffers.</p><p><strong>Attack Phase</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The information gathered in the pre-attack phase forms the basis of the attack strategy. During the attack phase, the attack strategy is developed and executed. This phase involves the actual compromise of the target. The tester may exploit a vulnerability discovered during the pre-attack phase or use security loopholes such as a weak security policy to gain access to the system. The important point here is that while the tester needs only one port of entry, organizations must defend several. Once inside, the tester may escalate their privileges, install a backdoor to sustain access to the system, and exploit it to achieve their goal.</p><p><strong>Post-attack Phase</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The post-attack phase is a crucial part of the testing process, as the tester needs to restore the network to its original state. This involves cleaning up testing processes, removing created vulnerabilities (not those that existed originally), crafted exploits, and so on, until all systems tested are returned to their pre-testing states.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The objective of the test is to show where security fails. Unless there is a scaling of the penetration test agreement, whereby the tester is assigned the responsibility to correct the security posture of the systems, this phase completes the process of penetration testing.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Activities in this phase include (but are not restricted to) the following:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Reversing all file and setting manipulations performed during the test</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Reversing all changes to privileges and user settings</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mapping of the network state</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Documenting and capturing all logs registered during the test</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">It is important that the penetration tester documents all their activities and records all observations and results so that the test can be repeated and verified for the given security posture of the organization. For the organization to quantify the security risk in business terms, it is essential that the tester identifies the critical systems and critical resources and maps the threat to these.</p></div>
