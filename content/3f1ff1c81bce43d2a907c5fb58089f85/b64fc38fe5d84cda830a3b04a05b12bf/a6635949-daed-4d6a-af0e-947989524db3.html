  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">The process for performing a penetration test in an organization consists of some critical decisions regarding the actions taken before testing the networking devices and system vulnerabilities.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The process is defined for all the operations performed during and prior to the penetration test, and it entails defining the scope, performing the penetration test, and reporting and delivering results.</p><p><strong>Defining the Scope</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Before performing a penetration test, it is necessary to first define the range of testing. For different types of penetration testing, different types of network devices exist. The test can either be a full-scale test for the entire network and systems or for target devices such as web servers, routers, firewalls, DNS servers, mail severs, and FTP servers. The scope of penetration testing covers the following:</p><ul><li>Extent of testing</li><li>What will be tested</li><li>Where testing will be performed from</li><li>Who will perform testing</li></ul><p><strong>Performing the Penetration Test</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">All companies ensure that the processes they implement for penetration testing are appropriate. Therefore, a good penetration test requires the use of proper methodologies. The tester is responsible for checking the system for any existing or new applications, networks, and systems, in addition to checking whether the system is vulnerable to a security risk that could allow unauthorized access. This process involves gathering all the information significant to security vulnerabilities. This also involves testing the targeted environment such as network configuration, topology, hardware, and software.</p><p><strong>Reporting and Delivering Results</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Once the penetration testing is complete, security testers examine all the information derived from the testing procedure. The delivery report contains the following:</p><ul><li>List of prioritized vulnerabilities and risks</li><li>Information pertaining to the strong and weak points of the existing security system</li><li>Risks categorized as high, medium, or low</li><li>Information about each deviceâ€™s vulnerabilities</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">Testers make recommendations for repairing the vulnerabilities found and provide technical information on how to fix the vulnerabilities found in the system. They can also provide certain useful resources to the organization such as Internet links that may be helpful for finding additional information or patches to repair found vulnerabilities.</p></div>
