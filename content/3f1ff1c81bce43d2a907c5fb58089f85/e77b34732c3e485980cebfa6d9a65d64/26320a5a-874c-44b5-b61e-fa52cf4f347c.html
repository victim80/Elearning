  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are some of the benefits of conducting a penetration test:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reveal vulnerabilities:</strong> In addition to revealing existing weaknesses in a system or application configurations, a penetration test investigates the action and behavior of an organization’s staff that could lead to a data breach. Finally, the tester provides a report containing updates on security vulnerabilities as well as recommendations and policies to improve the overall security.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Show real risks:&nbsp;</strong>The tester exploits the identified vulnerabilities to check how a real attacker could behave.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ensure business continuity:&nbsp;</strong>A small interruption can have a great impact on a business. It can cost the company tens to thousands of dollars. Therefore, the availability of the network, access to the resources, and 24/7 communications are necessary to run the business operation. A penetration test discloses potential threats and recommends solutions to ensure that the business operation will not be affected by an unexpected downtime or a loss of accessibility.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reducing client-end attacks:</strong> An attacker can break into an organization’s systems from the client side, especially via web and online form services. Companies should be prepared to protect their systems from such attacks. If an organization knows which kind of attacks can be expected, then they know the signs to look out for and must be able to update the application.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Establishing the status of the company in terms of security:</strong> Penetration testing provides knowledge of the security level of a company and its status in terms of security. The tester provides a report on the company’s overall security system and areas needing improvements, and the report includes details on the protection of the protection of its infrastructure and effectiveness of existing security measures.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Guard the reputation of the company:</strong> It is important for a company to maintain a good reputation with its partners and clients. Gaining the trust and support of even loyal partners is difficult if the company is affected by a data breach or attack. Organizations should regularly perform penetration tests to protect their data and the trust of their partners and clients.</li></ul></div>
