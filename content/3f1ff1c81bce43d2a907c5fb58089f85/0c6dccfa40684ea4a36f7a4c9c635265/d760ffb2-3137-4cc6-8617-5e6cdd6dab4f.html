  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Penetration testing, also called pen testing, goes a step ahead of vulnerability scanning in security assessment. Unlike vulnerability scanning, which examines the security of individual computers, network devices, or applications, penetration testing assesses the security model of the network as a whole. Penetration testing can reveal the potential consequences of a real attacker breaking into the accounts of network-to-network administrators, IT managers, and executives. It also sheds light on the security weaknesses missed in typical vulnerability scanning.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Penetration testing is a type of security testing that evaluates an organization’s ability to protect its infrastructure such as network, applications, systems, and users from external as well as internal threats. It is an effective way of determining the efficacy of the organization’s security policies, controls, and technologies. It involves the active evaluation of the security of the organization’s infrastructure by simulating an attack similar to those performed by real attackers. During a penetration test, security measures are actively analyzed for design weaknesses, technical flaws, and vulnerabilities. The test results are documented and delivered in a comprehensive report to executive management and technical audiences.</p></div>
