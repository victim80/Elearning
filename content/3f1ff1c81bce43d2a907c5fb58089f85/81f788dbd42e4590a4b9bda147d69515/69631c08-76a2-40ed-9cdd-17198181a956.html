  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Before performing any pen test in an organization, the tester must follow some steps to ensure success. First, the organization must call for a meeting, in which they must discuss the scope and objectives of the penetration test and the parties involved in it. The objectives are important because they describe that exploitable vulnerabilities exist within the organizationâ€™s infrastructure. The objectives of the penetration test must be clear; if the objective is unclear, then the results will inevitably be inaccurate. Next, the systems, machines, network, staff involved, and operational requirements are identified to perform the penetration test.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Another important agenda is the time and duration of the penetration test; these factors should be decided in such a manner that the daily operations and normal business of the organization will not be disturbed. No organization wants their businesses to be affected by a penetration test. Therefore, the organization must ensure that the penetration test is conducted at a particular time of the day because, at times, penetration testing can lead to unusual network traffic, which may cause some systems on the network to crash and affect other working systems on the network. To overcome such situations, the organization must draw a clear plan before proceeding.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are a few more points on the characteristics of a good penetration test:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Establishing the parameters of the penetration test such as objectives, limitations, and justification of procedures</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Hiring skilled and experienced professionals to perform the test</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Choosing a suitable set of tests that balance cost and benefits</li><li style="text-align: left;">Following a methodology with proper planning and documentation</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Documenting the result carefully and making it comprehensible for the client</li></ul></div>
