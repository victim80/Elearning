  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Often, penetration testers are called ethical hackers because they breach a network or system with prior permission from or agreement with the concerned person or organization; without this prior permission or agreement, they are simply hackers. Companies mainly hire penetration testers to understand whether any part of their infrastructure or network is vulnerable to attacks and determine the existence of security holes that a hacker can easily exploit.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A penetration tester must therefore run several tests and prepare an assessment report detailing the tests and their results. Often, the tester runs predefined types of tests and designs their own tests as well to exploit vulnerabilities; to design a custom test, the tester requires a lot of creativity and imagination with a high level of technical knowledge.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, a penetration tester has the following responsibilities:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Perform the penetration testing and risk assessment of the target system.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Clearly define the goals of the penetration test, ensure superior quality, and effectively communicate the results.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Exploit system vulnerabilities and justify found vulnerabilities.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Present reports to superiors on the efficiency of the tests and risk assessments, as well as proposals for risk mitigation.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Understand the security of the organizationâ€™s servers, network systems, and firewalls relevant to specific business risks</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Create and design new penetration tools for testing vulnerabilities.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Identify the methods and techniques that an attacker could use to exploit weaknesses and logic flaws.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Perform social engineering to discover poor password policies or user security practices in an organization.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Conduct physical security assessments of servers, systems, and network devices.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Investigate web applications, client applications, and standard applications for any vulnerabilities.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Include all business considerations such as loss due to downtime and cost of engagement into security strategies.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Review and define requirements for information security solutions.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Provide feedback, which is very important for the organization to fix security issues.</li></ul></div>
