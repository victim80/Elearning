Different types of audits are used to evaluate a company’s security processes. A security audit only checks whether the organization follows a set of standard security policies and procedures.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Vulnerability assessment:</strong> This is used for identifying and measuring the severity of vulnerability in a system; usually, it is used to identify common vulnerabilities in a system’s configuration. Vulnerability assessment provides organizations with a list of vulnerabilities that need to be fixed, without estimating specific goals or scenarios. The list is provided according to the severity level of the vulnerability or business criticality. Vulnerability assessment is suitable for an organization that is not secure, wishes to get started, has a medium-to-high security maturity, and wishes to maintain the security posture of its network. Although vulnerability assessment focuses on identifying the vulnerabilities in an information system, it provides no indication of whether the vulnerabilities can be exploited or of the amount of damage that may result from their successful exploitation.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Penetration testing:</strong> A penetration test is a goal-oriented exercise; it focuses on real-time attacks instead of discovering a specific vulnerability. The penetration tester acts as a hacker and follows all the steps a real hacker would to breach a system. This type of testing is suitable for organizations at a high maturity level of security. Penetration testing is a methodological approach to security assessment that encompasses a security audit and vulnerability assessment, and it demonstrates whether the vulnerabilities in the system can be successfully exploited by attackers as well as the amount of damage that may result from the successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities.</li></ul></div>
