  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Various penetration testing frameworks and methodologies exist to help organizations choose the best method to conduct a successful penetration test. The cornerstone of a successful penetration test is the methodology involved in devising it. The underlying methodology should help the tester by providing a systematic approach to the testing pattern. The test must satisfy adjectives such as consistency, accuracy, and efficiency, and the testing methodology should be adequate. This does not mean that the entire framework should be restrictive.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The two types of penetration testing methodologies are as follows:</p><p><strong>Proprietary methodologies</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">There are many organizations that work on penetration testing and offer services and certifications. Network security organizations have their own methodologies that are to be kept confidential. The following are some proprietary methodologies:</p><ul><li>EC-Council’s Licensed Penetration Tester (LPT)</li><li>IBM</li><li>ISS</li><li>McAfee Foundstone</li></ul><p><strong>Open-source and public methodologies</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">A wide range of methodologies are publicly available. They can be used by anybody and are intended for public use only.</p><p><strong>Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual was compiled by Pete Herzog. It is a standard set for penetration testing to achieve security metrics. It is considered the de-facto highest level of testing, and it ensures high consistency and remarkable accuracy.</p><p><strong>Information Systems Security Assessment Framework</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The Information Systems Security Assessment Framework evaluates an organization’s information security processes and policies.</p><p><strong>National Institute of Standards and Technology</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a federal technology agency that works with the industry to develop and apply technology, measurements, and standards.</p><p><strong>Open Web Application Security Project</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The Open Web Application Security Project is an open-source methodology. It provides a set of tools and a knowledge base, which help in protecting web applications and services. It is beneficial for system architects, vendors, developers, security professionals, and consumers who might work on designing, developing, deploying, and testing the security of web services and web applications.</p><p><strong>CREST</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">CREST is the not-for-profit accreditation and certification body representing the technical information security industry. CREST provides internationally recognized accreditation for organizations and individuals providing penetration testing, cyber incident response and threat intelligence services.</p></div>
