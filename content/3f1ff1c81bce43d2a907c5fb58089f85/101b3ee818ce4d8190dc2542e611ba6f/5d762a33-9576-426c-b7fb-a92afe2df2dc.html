  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Penetration testing must be performed on a regular basis to ensure that all existing and newly discovered vulnerabilities are identified and fixed before a cybercriminal exploits them. In recent times, many new attacks have been reported, which indicates that even hackers are attempting new methodologies and techniques. An organization must be prepared with solutions for any new kind of attack. However, most companies neglect the possibility of such a situation and wait too long to conduct penetration testing; they conduct tests either when it is required by law or, in the worst case, only when a company has already been breached.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The question of when pen testing should be performed is difficult to answer because the answer depends on the company. For instance, high-profile companies that are often mentioned in the media are the most prone to attacks. Such companies must regularly perform penetration testing.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are some scenarios where penetration testing is required:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Changes have been made in the organization’s infrastructure.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A new threat to the organization’s infrastructure has been discovered.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Hardware or software has been updated or reinstalled.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The organization’s policy has changed.</li></ul></div>
