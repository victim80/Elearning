  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">To detect phishing emails, first, hover your mouse pointer over the name in the “<strong>From</strong>” column. Doing so will show whether the original domain name is linked to the sender’s name; if it is not, then it could be a phishing email. For example, an email from Gmail.com should probably display it’s “<strong>From</strong>” domain as “<strong>gmail.com</strong>.”</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Check to see if the email provides a URL and prompts the user to click on it. If so, ensure that the link is legitimate by hovering the mouse pointer over it (to display the link’s URL) and ensure it uses encryption (https://). To be on the safe side, always open a new window and visit the site by typing it in directly instead of clicking on the link provided in the email.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Do not provide any information to the suspicious website, as it will likely link directly to the attacker.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A few other indicators of phishing emails:</p><ul><li>It seems to be from a bank, company, or social networking site and has a generic greeting</li><li>It seems to be from a person listed in your email address book</li><li>It has an urgent tone or makes a veiled threat</li><li>It may contain grammatical or spelling mistakes</li><li>It includes links to spoofed websites</li><li>It may contain offers that seem to be too good to be true</li><li>It includes official-looking logos and other information taken from legitimate websites</li><li>It may contain a malicious attachment</li></ul></div>
