  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Many factors make companies vulnerable to social engineering attacks; some of them are as follows:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Insufficient Security Training</strong>: Employees can be ignorant about the social engineering tricks used by attackers to lure them into divulging sensitive data about the organization. Therefore, the minimum responsibility of any organization is to educate their employees about social engineering techniques and the threats associated with them to prevent social engineering attacks.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Unregulated Access to Information</strong>: For any company, one of its main assets is its database. Providing unlimited access or allowing everyone access to such sensitive data might cause trouble. Therefore, companies must ensure proper training for and surveillance of key personnel accessing sensitive data.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Several Organizational Units:&nbsp;</strong>Some organizations have their units at different geographic locations, making it difficult to manage the system. Further, this sort of setup makes it easier for an attacker to access the organizationâ€™s sensitive information.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Lack of Security Policies</strong>: Security policy is the foundation of security infrastructure. It is a high-level document describing the security controls implemented in a company. An organization should take extreme measures related to every possible security threat or vulnerability. Implementation of certain security measures such as password change policy, information sharing policy, access privileges, unique user identification, and centralized security, prove to be beneficial.</li></ul></div>
