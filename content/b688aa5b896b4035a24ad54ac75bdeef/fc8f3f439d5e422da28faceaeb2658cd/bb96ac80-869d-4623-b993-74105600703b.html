  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers may send a fake security application to perform mobile-based social engineering. In this attack, the attacker first infects the victim’s computer by sending something malicious. They then upload a malicious application to an app store. When the victim logs on to their bank account, malware in the system displays a pop-up message telling the victim that they need to download an application on their phone to receive a message from security. The victim downloads the application from the attacker’s app store, believing they are downloading a genuine app. Once the user downloads the application, the attacker obtains confidential information such as bank account login credentials (username and password), whereupon a second authentication is sent by the bank to the victim via SMS. Using that information, the attacker accesses the victim’s bank account.</p></div>
