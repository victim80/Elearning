  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">An insider is any employee (trusted person) who has access to the critical assets of an organization. An insider attack involves using privileged access to violate rules or intentionally cause a threat to the organization’s information or information systems. Insiders can easily bypass security rules, corrupt valuable resources, and access sensitive information. Insider attacks may cause great loss to the company. Further, they are dangerous because they are easy to launch and difficult to detect.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Insider attacks are generally performed by:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Privileged Users</strong>: Attacks may come from the most trusted employees of the company, such as managers and system administrators, who have access to the company’s confidential data and a higher probability of misusing the data, either intentionally or unintentionally.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Disgruntled Employees</strong>: Attacks may come from unhappy employees or contract workers. Disgruntled employees, who intend to take revenge on the company, first acquire information and then wait for the right time to compromise the organization’s resources.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Terminated Employees</strong>: Some employees take valuable information about the company with them when terminated. These employees access the company’s data after termination using backdoors, malware, or their old credentials if they are not disabled.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Accident-Prone Employee</strong><strong>s</strong>: If an employee accidentally loses their mobile device, sends an email to incorrect recipients, or leaves a system loaded with confidential data logged-in, it can lead to unintentional data disclosure.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Third Parties</strong>: Third parties, like remote employees, partners, dealers, and vendors, have access to the company’s information. However, the security of their systems is unpredictable and could be a source of information leaks.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Undertrained Staff</strong>: A trusted employee becomes an unintentional insider due to a lack of cybersecurity training. They fail to adhere to cybersecurity policies, procedures, guidelines, and best practices.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">Companies in which insider attacks are common include credit card companies, health-care companies, network service providers, as well as financial and exchange service providers.</p><p><strong>Example of Insider Attack: Disgruntled Employee</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Most cases of insider abuse can be traced to individuals who are introverts, incapable of managing stress, experiencing conflict with management, frustrated with their job or office politics, craving respect or promotion, transferred, demoted, or issued an employment termination notice, among other reasons. Disgruntled employees may pass company secrets and intellectual property to competitors for monetary gain, thus harming the organization.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Disgruntled employees can use steganography programs to hide company secrets and later send the information to competitors as an innocuous-looking message such as a picture, image, or sound file using a work email account. No one suspects them because the attacker hides the stolen sensitive information in the picture or image file.</p></div>
