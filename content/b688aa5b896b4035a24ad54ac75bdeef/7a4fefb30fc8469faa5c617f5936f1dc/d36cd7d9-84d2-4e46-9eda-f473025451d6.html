  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p>There are four types of insider threats. They are:</p><p><strong>Malicious Insider</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Malicious insider threats come from disgruntled or terminated employees who steal data or destroy company networks intentionally by injecting malware into the corporate network.</p><p><strong>Negligent Insider</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Insiders, who are uneducated on potential security threats or simply bypass general security procedures to meet workplace efficiency, are more vulnerable to social engineering attacks. Many insider attacks result from employee’s laxity towards security measures, policies, and practices.</p><p><strong>Professional Insider</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Professional insiders are the most harmful insiders. They use their technical knowledge to identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the company’s network and sell the organization’s confidential information to competitors or black-market bidders.</p><p><strong>Compromised Insider</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">An outsider compromises an insider who has access to the critical assets or computing devices of an organization. This type of threat is more difficult to detect since the outsider masquerades as a genuine insider.</p></div>
