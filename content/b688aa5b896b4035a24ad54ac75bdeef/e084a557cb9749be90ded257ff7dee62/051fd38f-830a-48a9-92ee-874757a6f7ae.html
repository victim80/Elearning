  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers implement social engineering techniques to trick people into revealing organizations’ confidential information. They use social engineering to perform fraud, identity theft, industrial espionage, and other disreputable behaviors. To guard against social engineering attacks, organizations must develop effective policies and procedures; however, merely developing them is not enough.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">To be truly effective, an organization should:&nbsp;</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Disseminate policies among employees and provide proper education and training. Specialized training benefits employees in higher-risk positions against social engineering threats.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Obtain employee signatures on a statement acknowledging that they understand the organization’s policies.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Define the consequences of policy violations.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">The main objectives of social engineering defense strategies are to create user awareness, robust internal network controls, and security policies, plans, and processes.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Official security policies and procedures help employees or users make the right security decisions. They should include the following safeguards:</p><p><strong>Password Policies&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Password policies stating the following guidelines help to increase password security:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Change passwords regularly.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Avoid passwords that are easy to guess. It is possible to guess passwords from answers to social engineering questions such as, “Where were you born?” “What is your favorite movie?” or "What is your pet’s name?"&nbsp;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Block user accounts if a user exceeds a certain number of failed attempts to guess a password.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Choose long (minimum of 6 – 8 characters) and complex (using various alphanumeric and special characters) passwords.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Do not disclose passwords to anyone.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">Password Security policies often include advice on proper password management, for example:</p><ul><li>Avoid sharing a computer account.</li><li>Avoid using the same password for different accounts.</li><li>Avoid storing passwords on media or writing them down on a notepad or sticky note.</li><li>Avoid communicating passwords over the phone or through email or SMS.</li><li>Be sure to lock or shut down the computer before stepping away from it.</li></ul><p><strong>Physical Security Policies&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Physical security policies address the following areas.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Issue identification cards (ID cards), and uniforms, along with other access control measures to the employees of the organization.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Office security or personnel must escort visitors to designated visitor rooms or lounges.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Restrict access to certain areas of an organization to prevent unauthorized users from compromising the security of sensitive data.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Dispose of old documents that contain valuable information by using equipment such as paper shredders and burn bins. This prevents information gathering by attackers using techniques such as dumpster diving.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Employ security personnel in an organization to protect people and property — supplement trained security personnel with alarm systems, surveillance cameras, and other equipment.</li></ul><p><strong>Defense Strategy</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Social Engineering Campaign</strong>: An organization should conduct numerous social engineering exercises using different techniques on a diverse group of people in order to examine how its employees might react to real social engineering attacks.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Gap Analysis</strong>: Using the information obtained from the social engineering campaign, a gap analysis evaluates the organization based on industry-leading practices, emerging threats, and mitigation strategies.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Remediation Strategies</strong>: Depending upon the result of the evaluation in the gap analysis, organizations develop a detailed remediation plan to mitigate the weaknesses or the loopholes found in the earlier step. The plan focuses mainly on educating and creating awareness among employees based on their roles and identifying and mitigating potential threats to the organization.</li></ul></div>
