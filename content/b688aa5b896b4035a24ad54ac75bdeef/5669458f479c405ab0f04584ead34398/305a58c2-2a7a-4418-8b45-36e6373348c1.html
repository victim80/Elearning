  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Sending SMS is another technique used by attackers in performing mobile-based social engineering. In SMiShing (SMS Phishing), the SMS text messaging system is used to lure users into taking instant action such as downloading malware, visiting a malicious webpage, or calling a fraudulent phone number. SMiShing messages are crafted to provoke an instant action from the victim, requiring them to divulge their personal information and account details.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Consider Tracy, a software engineer working in a reputed company. She receives an SMS ostensibly from the security department of XIM Bank. It claims to be urgent, and the message says that Tracy should call the phone number listed in the SMS immediately. Worried, she calls to check on her account, believing it to be an authentic XIM Bank customer service phone number. A recorded message asks her to provide her credit or debit card number, as well as her password. Tracy believes it is a genuine message and shares sensitive information.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Sometimes a message claims that the user has won money or has been randomly selected as a lucky winner and that they merely need to pay a nominal fee and share their email address, contact number, or other information.</p></div>
