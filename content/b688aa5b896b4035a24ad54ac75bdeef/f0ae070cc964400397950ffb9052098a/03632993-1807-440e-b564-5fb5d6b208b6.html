  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A social engineer uses the vulnerability of human nature as their most effective tool. Usually, people believe and trust others and derive fulfillment from helping the needy. Discussed below are the most common targets of social engineering in an organization:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Receptionists and Help-Desk Personnel</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Social engineers generally target service-desk or help-desk personnel by tricking them into divulging confidential information about the organization. To extract information, such as a phone number or password, the attacker first wins the trust of the individual with the information. On winning their trust, the attacker manipulates them to get valuable information. Receptionists and help-desk staff may readily share information if they feel they are doing so to help a customer.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Technical Support</strong> <strong>Executives</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Another target of social engineers is technical support executives. The social engineers may take the approach of contacting technical support executives to obtain sensitive information by pretending to be senior management, customers, vendors, or other figures.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>System</strong> Administrators:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>A system administrator in an organization is responsible for maintaining the systems. Thus, they may have critical information such as the type and version of OS and admin passwords, that could be helpful for an attacker in planning an attack.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Users and</strong> Clients:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Attackers could approach users and clients of the target organization, pretending to be a tech support person to extract sensitive information.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Vendors of the Target Organization</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Attackers may also target the vendors of the organization to gain critical information that could help in executing attacks.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Senior Executives:</strong> Attackers could also approach senior executives from various departments such as Finance, HR, and CxOs to obtain critical information about the organization.</li></ul></div>
