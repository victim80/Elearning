The email also appears to be from an individual from the recipient's company, generally someone in a position of authority. In reality, the message is sent by an attacker attempting to obtain critical information about a specific recipient and their organization, such as login credentials, credit card details, bank account numbers, passwords, confidential documents, financial information, and trade secrets. Spear phishing generates a higher response rate compared to a normal phishing attack, as it appears to be from a trusted company source.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Whaling</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">A whaling attack is a type of phishing that targets high profile executives like CEO, CFO, politicians, and celebrities who have complete access to confidential and highly valuable information. It is a social engineering trick in which the attacker tricks the victim into revealing critical corporate and personal information (like bank account details, employee details, customer information, and credit card details), generally, through email or website spoofing. Whaling is different from a normal phishing attack; the email or website used for the attack is carefully designed, usually targeting someone in the executive leadership.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Pharming</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Pharming is a social engineering technique in which the attacker executes malicious programs on a victim’s computer or server, and when the victim enters any URL or domain name, it automatically redirects the victim’s traffic to an attacker-controlled website. This attack is also known as “Phishing without a Lure.” The attacker steals confidential information like credentials, banking details, and other information related to web-based services.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Pharming attack can be performed in two ways: DNS cache poisoning and host file modification. Pharming attacks can also be performed using malware like Trojan horses or worms.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Spimming</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">SPIM (Spam over Instant Messaging) exploits Instant Messaging platforms and uses IM as a tool to spread spam. A person who generates spam over IM is called Spimmer. Spimmers generally make use of bots (an application that executes automated tasks over the network) to harvest Instant Message IDs and forward spam messages to them. SPIM messages, like email spam, generally include advertisements and malware as an attachment or embedded hyperlink. The user clicks the attachment and is redirected to a malicious website that collects financial and personal information like credentials, bank account, and credit card details.</p></div>
