The attacker registers a fake domain name, builds a lookalike website, and then mails the fake website’s link to users. When a user clicks on the email link, it redirects them to the fake webpage, where they are lured into sharing sensitive details such as their address and credit card information. Some of the reasons behind the success of phishing scams include users’ lack of knowledge, being visually deceived, and not paying attention to security indicators.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The screenshot below is an example of an illegitimate email that claims to be from a legitimate sender. The email link redirects users to a fake webpage and asks them to submit their personal or financial details.</p></div>
