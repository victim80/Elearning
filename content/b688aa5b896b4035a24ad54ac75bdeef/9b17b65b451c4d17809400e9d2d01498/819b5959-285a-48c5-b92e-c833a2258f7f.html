  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Before performing a social engineering attack, the attacker gathers information about the target organization from various sources such as:</p><ul><li>The organization’s official websites, where employees’ IDs, names, and email addresses are shared</li><li>Advertisements of the target organization cast through media reveal information such as products and offers.</li><li>Blogs, forums, and other online spaces where employees share basic personal and organizational information.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">After gathering information, an attacker executes social engineering attacks using various approaches such as impersonation, piggybacking, tailgating, reverse social engineering, and other methods.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Social engineering is the art of manipulating people to divulge sensitive information to use it to perform some malicious action. Despite security policies, attackers can compromise an organization’s sensitive information by using social engineering, which targets the weakness of people. Most often, employees are not even aware of a security lapse on their part and inadvertently reveal the organization’s critical information. For instance, unwittingly answering strangers’ questions or replying to spam email.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">To succeed, attackers take a special interest in developing social engineering skills and can be so proficient that the victims might not even notice the fraud. Attackers always look for new ways to access information. They also ensure that they know the organization’s perimeter and the people on its perimeter, such as security guards, receptionists, and help-desk workers, to exploit human oversight. People have conditioned themselves to not be overly suspicious, and they associate specific behaviors and appearances with known entities. For instance, a man in a uniform carrying a pile of packages for delivery will be perceived as a delivery person. With the help of social engineering tricks, attackers succeed in obtaining confidential information, authorization, and access details from people by deceiving and manipulating human vulnerability.</p></div>
