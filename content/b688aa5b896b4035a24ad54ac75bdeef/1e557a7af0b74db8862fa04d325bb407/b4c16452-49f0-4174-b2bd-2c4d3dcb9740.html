A window appears on the screen requesting the user to re-login or warning about an interruption in the host connection, and that the network connection needs re-authentication. When the user follows these instructions, a malicious program installs, extracts the target’s sensitive information, and sends it to the attacker’s email address or a remote site. This type of attack uses trojans and viruses.</p><p><strong>Examples of pop-ups used for tricking users</strong>:</p></div>
