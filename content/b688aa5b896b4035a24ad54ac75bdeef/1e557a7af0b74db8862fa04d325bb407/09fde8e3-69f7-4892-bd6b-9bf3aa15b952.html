It relies on social engineering to spread its reach. Usually, hoaxes do not cause any physical damage or loss of information; but they cause a loss of productivity and use an organization’s valuable network resources.</p><p><strong>Chain</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Letters</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A chain letter is a message offering free gifts, such as money and software, on the condition that the user forwards the email to a predetermined number of recipients. Common approaches used in chain letters are emotionally convincing stories, “<strong>get-rich-quick</strong>” pyramid schemes, spiritual beliefs, and superstitious threats of bad luck to the recipient if they “break the chain" and fail to pass on the message or simply refuse to read its content. Chain letters also rely on social engineering to spread.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Instant</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Chat</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Messenger</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">An attacker chats with selected online users via instant chat messengers and tries to gather their personal information such as date of birth or maiden name. They then use the acquired information to crack users’ accounts.</p><p><strong>Spam Email</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Spam is irrelevant, unwanted, and unsolicited emails designed to collect financial information such as social security numbers, and network information. Attackers send spam messages to the target to collect sensitive information, such as bank details. Attackers may also send email attachments with hidden malicious programs such as viruses and trojans. Social engineers try to hide the file extension by giving the attachment a long filename.</p><p><strong>Scareware</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Scareware is a type of malware that tricks computer users into visiting malware-infested websites or downloading or buying potentially malicious software. Scareware is often seen in pop-ups that tell the target user that their machine has been infected with malware. These pop-ups convincingly appear as though they are coming from a legitimate source such as an antivirus company. Further, these pop-up ads always have a sense of urgency and tell the victim to quickly download the software if they want to get rid of the supposed virus.</p></div>
