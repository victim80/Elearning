  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p><strong>Authority</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Authority implies the right to exercise power in an organization. Attackers take advantage of this by presenting themselves as a person of authority, such as a technician or an executive, in a target organization to steal important data.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For example, an attacker can call a user on the phone and can claim to be working as a network administrator in the target organization. The attacker then informs the victim about a security incident in the network and asks them to provide their account credentials to protect their data against theft. After obtaining the victim’s credentials, the attacker steals sensitive information from the victim’s account.</p><p><strong>Intimidation</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Intimidation refers to an attempt to intimidate a victim into taking several actions by using bullying tactics. It is usually performed by impersonating some other person and manipulating users into disclosing sensitive information.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For example, an attacker might call the executive’s receptionist with this request:</p><p style="text-align:justify;">“Mr. Tibiyani is about to give a big presentation to the customers, but he is unable to open his files; it seems they are corrupt. He told me to call you and ask you to send the files to me immediately so that he can start his talk.”</p><p><strong>Consensus or Social Proof</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Consensus or social proof refers to the fact that people are usually willing to like things or do things that other people like or do.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers take advantage of this by doing things like creating websites and posting fake testimonials from users about the benefits of certain products such as anti-malware (rogueware). Therefore, if users search the Internet to download the rogueware, they encounter these websites and believe the forged testimonials. Further, if users download the malicious product, attackers may install a trojan along with it.</p><p><strong>Scarcity</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Scarcity implies the state of being scarce. In the context of social engineering, scarcity often implies creating a feeling of urgency in a decision-making process. Due to this urgency, attackers can control the information provided to victims and manipulate the decision-making process.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For example, when Apple releases a new iPhone product that sells out and goes out of stock, attackers can take advantage of this situation by sending a phishing email to the target users, encouraging them to click on a link provided in the email to buy the product. If the users click on this link, they get redirected to some malicious website controlled by the attacker. As a result, the user might end up revealing their account details or downloading some malicious programs such as trojans.</p><p><strong>Urgency</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Urgency implies encouraging people to take immediate action. Attackers can take advantage of this by tricking victims into performing unintended tasks.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For example, ransomware often uses the urgency principle, which makes the victim take urgent action under a time-limit. The victims see the countdown timer running on their infected systems and know that failure to make the required decision within the given time can result in the loss of important data.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, attackers can send phishing emails indicating that a certain product is available at a low price and that to buy it, the user should click on the “Buy Now” link. The user is tricked, and they click on the link to take immediate action. As a result, they are redirected to a malicious website and end up revealing their account details or downloading a virus file.</p><p><strong>Familiarity or Liking</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Familiarity or liking implies that people are more likely to be persuaded to do something when they are asked by someone whom they like. This indicates that people are more likely to buy products if they are advertised by an admired celebrity.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For example, people are more likely to allow someone to look over their shoulder if they like that person or they are familiar with them. If people do not like the person, they immediately recognize the shoulder surfing attack and prevent it. Similarly, people often allow someone to tailgate them if they like that person or are familiar with them. In some cases, social engineers use a charming smile and sweet-talk to deceive the other person into liking them.</p><p><strong>Trust</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers often attempt to build a trusting relationship with victims.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For example, an attacker can call a victim and introduce themself as a security expert. Then, they may claim that they were working with XYZ company, and they noticed some unusual errors sent from the victim’s system. The attacker builds trust by using the company name and their experience in the security field. After establishing trust, the attacker guides the victim to follow a series of steps to “view and disable the system errors.” They later send an email containing a malicious file and persuade the victim to click on and download it. Through this process, the attacker successfully installs malware on the victim’s system, infecting it and allowing the attacker to steal important information.</p><p><strong>Greed</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Some people are possessive by nature and seek to acquire vast amounts of wealth through illegal activities. Social engineers lure their targets to divulge information by promising something for nothing (appealing to their greed).</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For example, an attacker may pretend to be a competitor and lure the employees of the target into revealing critical information by offering a considerable reward.</p></div>
