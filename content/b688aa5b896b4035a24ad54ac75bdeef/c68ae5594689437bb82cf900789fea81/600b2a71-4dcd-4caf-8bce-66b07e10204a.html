  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Identity theft is constantly increasing, and identity thieves are finding new ways or techniques to steal different types of target information. Some of the types of identity theft are as follows:</p><p><strong>Child Identity Theft&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This type of identity theft occurs when the identity of a minor is stolen. This is desirable because it may go undetected for a long time. After birth, parents apply for a Social Security Number for their child, which along with a different date of birth, is used by identity thieves to apply for credit accounts, loans or utility services, or to rent a place to live and apply for government benefits.</p><p><strong>Criminal Identity Theft</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This is one of the most common and most damaging types of identity theft. A criminal uses someone’s identity to escape criminal charges. When they are caught or arrested, they provide the assumed identity. The best way to protect against criminal identity theft is to keep all personal information secure, which includes following safe Internet practices and being cautious of “shoulder surfers.”</p><p><strong>Financial Identity Theft</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This type of identity theft occurs when a victim’s bank account or credit card information is stolen and illegally used by a thief. They can max out a credit card and withdraw money from the account, or can use the stolen identity to open a new account, apply for new credit cards, and take out loans. The information that is required to hack into the victim’s account and steal their information is obtained through viruses, phishing attacks, or data breaches.</p><p><strong>Driver’s License Identity Theft</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This type of identity theft is the easiest as it requires a little sophistication. A person can lose their driver’s license, or it can easily be stolen. Once it falls into the wrong hands, the perpetrator can sell the stolen driver’s license or misuse it by committing traffic violations, of which the victim is unaware of and fails to pay fines for, ending up with their license suspended or revoked.</p><p><strong>Insurance Identity Theft</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Insurance identity theft is closely related to medical identity theft. It takes place when a perpetrator unlawfully takes the victim’s medical information to access their insurance for medical treatment. Its effects include difficulties in settling medical bills, higher insurance premiums, and probable trouble in acquiring future medical coverage.</p><p><strong>Medical Identity Theft</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This is the most dangerous type of identity theft where the perpetrator uses the victim’s name or information without the victim’s consent or knowledge to obtain medical products and claim health insurance or healthcare services. Medical identity theft results in frequent erroneous entries in the victim’s medical records, which could lead to false diagnoses and life-threatening decisions by the doctors.</p><p><strong>Tax Identity Theft</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This type of identity theft occurs when the perpetrator steals the victim’s Social Security Number to file fraudulent tax returns and obtain fraudulent tax refunds. It creates difficulties for the victim in accessing their legitimate tax refunds and results in a loss of funds. Phishing emails are one of the main tricks used by the criminal to steal a target’s information. Therefore, protection from such identity theft includes the adoption of safe Internet practices.</p><p><strong>Identity Cloning and Concealment</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This type of identity theft encompasses all forms of identity theft, where the perpetrators attempt to impersonate someone else simply in order to hide their identity. These perpetrators could be illegal immigrants, those hiding from creditors, or simply those who want to become “anonymous.”</p><p><strong>Synthetic Identity Theft</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This is one of the most sophisticated types of identity theft, where the perpetrator obtains information from different victims to create a new identity. Firstly, he steals a Social Security Number and uses it with a combination of fake names, date of birth, address, and other details required for creating a new identity. The perpetrator uses this new identity to open new accounts, loans, credit cards, phones, other goods, and services.</p><p><strong>Social Security Identity Theft</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This is another common type of identity theft where the perpetrator steals victim’s Social Security Number in order to derive various benefits such as selling it to an undocumented person, using it to defraud the government by getting a new bank account, loans, credit cards, or applying for and obtaining a new passport.</p></div>
