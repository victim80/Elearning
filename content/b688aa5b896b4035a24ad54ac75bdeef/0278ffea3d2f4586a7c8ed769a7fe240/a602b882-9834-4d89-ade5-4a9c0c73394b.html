  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">There are safety measures that help an organization to prevent or minimize insider threats:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Separation and rotation of duties</strong>: Divide responsibilities among multiple employees to restrict the amount of power or influence held by any individual. This helps to avoid fraud, abuse, and conflict of interest and facilitates the detection of control failures (including bypassing security controls and information theft). Rotation of duties at random intervals helps an organization to deter fraud or the abuse of privileges.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Least privileges</strong>: Provide users with only enough access privilege to allow them to perform their assigned tasks. This helps maintain information security.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Controlled access</strong>: Access controls in various parts of an organization restrict unauthorized users from gaining access to critical assets and resources.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Logging and auditing</strong>: Perform logging and auditing periodically to check for misuse of company resources.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Employee monitoring</strong>: Use employee monitoring software that records all user sessions, and that can be reviewed by security professionals.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Legal policies</strong>: Enforce legal policies to prevent employees from misusing the organization’s resources and sensitive data theft.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Archive critical dat</strong><strong>a</strong>: Maintain a record of the organization’s critical data in the form of archives to be used as backup resources, if needed.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Employee training on cybersecurity</strong>: Train employees on how to protect their credentials and the company’s confidential data from attack. They will be able to identify social engineering attempts and take proper mitigations and reporting steps.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Employee background verification</strong>: Ensure thorough background checks of all employees before hiring them by using Google search and social networking sites and consulting previous employers.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Privileged users monitoring</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Implement additional monitoring mechanisms for system administrators and privileged users as these accounts can be used to can deploy malicious code or logic bomb on the system or network.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Credentials deactivation for terminated employees</strong>: Disable all the employee’s access profiles to the physical locations, networks, systems, applications, and data immediately after termination.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Periodic risk assessments</strong>: Perform periodic risk assessments on all the organization’s critical assets then develop and maintain a risk management strategy to secure those assets from both insiders and outsiders.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Layered defense</strong>: Implement multiple layers of defense to prevent and protect critical assets from remote attacks originated from insiders. Develop appropriate remote access policies and procedures to thwart such attacks.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Physical security</strong>: Build a professional security team that monitors the physical security of the organization.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Surveillance</strong>: Install video cameras to monitor all critical assets. Install and enable screen-capturing software on all critical servers.</li></ul></div>
