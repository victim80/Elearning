Although it focuses on fallacies and advocates effective countermeasures, the possible methods of extracting information from another human being rely on attackersâ€™ ingenuity. The features of these techniques make them an art, but the psychological nature of some of them makes them a science. The bottom line is that there is no ready defense against social engineering; only constant vigilance can circumvent the social engineering techniques used by attackers.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">This module provides an insight into human-based, computer-based, and mobile-based social engineering techniques. It also discusses various insider threats, especially, identity theft, as well as possible countermeasures.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">At the end of this module, you will be able to do the following:</p><ul><li>Describe social engineering concepts</li><li>Perform social engineering using various techniques</li><li>Describe insider threats</li><li>Describe identity theft</li><li>Apply social engineering countermeasures</li><li>Apply knowledge of insider threats and identity theft countermeasures</li></ul></div>
