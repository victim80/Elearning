  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Pass-the-ticket is a technique used for authenticating a user to a system that is using Kerberos tickets without providing the userâ€™s password. Kerberos authentication allows users to access services provided by remote servers without the need to provide passwords for every requested service. To perform this attack, the attacker dumps Kerberos tickets of legitimate accounts using credential dumping tools. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A TGT or ST can be captured based on the level of access permitted to a client. Here, the ST permits access to specific resources, and the TGT is used to send a request to the TGS for the ST to access all the services the client has been authorized to access.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Silver Tickets are captured for resources that use Kerberos for the authentication process and can be used to create tickets to call a specific service and access the system that offers the service.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Golden tickets are captured for the domain with the KDS KRBTGT NTLM hash that allows the creation of TGTs for any profile in the Active Directory.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers launch pass-the-ticket attacks either by stealing the ST/TGT from an end-user machine and using it to disguise themselves as a valid user, or by stealing the ST/TGT from a compromised AS. After obtaining one of these tickets, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the network services and search for additional permissions and critical data.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers use tools such as Mimikatz, Rubeus, Windows Credentials Editor, etc. to launch pass-the-ticket attacks.</p></div>
