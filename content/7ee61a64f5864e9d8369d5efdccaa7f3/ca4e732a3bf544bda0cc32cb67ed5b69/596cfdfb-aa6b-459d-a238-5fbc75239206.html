  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Password cracking is the process of recovering passwords from the data transmitted by a computer system or from the data stored in it. The purpose of cracking a password might be to help a user recover a forgotten or lost password, as a preventive measure by system administrators to check for easily breakable passwords, or for use by an attacker to gain unauthorized system access.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Hacking often begins with password-cracking attempts. A password is a key piece of information necessary to access a system. Consequently, most attackers use password-cracking techniques to gain unauthorized access. An attacker may either crack a password manually by guessing it or use automated tools and techniques such as a dictionary or a brute-force method. Most password-cracking techniques are successful because of weak or easily guessable passwords.</p></div>
