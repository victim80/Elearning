The software initially appears to perform a desirable or benign function, but instead steals information or harms the system. With a Trojan, attackers can gain remote access and perform various operations limited by user privileges on the target computer.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Spyware is a type of malware that attackers install on a computer to secretly gather information about its users without their knowledge. Spyware hides itself from the user and can be difficult to detect.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A keylogger is a program that records all user keystrokes without the user’s knowledge. Keyloggers ship the log of user keystrokes to an attacker’s machine or hide it in the victim’s machine for later retrieval. The attacker then scrutinizes the log to find passwords or other useful information that could compromise the system.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">An attacker installs a Trojan/spyware/keylogger on a victim’s machine to collect their usernames and passwords. These programs run in the background and send back all user credentials to the attacker.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For example, a key logger on a victim’s computer can reveal the contents of all user emails. The following image depicts a scenario describing how an attacker gains password access using a Trojan/spyware/keylogger.</p></div>
