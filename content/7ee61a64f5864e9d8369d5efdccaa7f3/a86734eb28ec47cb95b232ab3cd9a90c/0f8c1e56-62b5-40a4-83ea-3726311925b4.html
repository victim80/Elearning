It is the most important element that users should ensure while creating a password. The password should not be simple, as such passwords are prone to attacks. The passwords that you choose should always be complex, long, and difficult to remember. The password that you are setting for your account must meet the complexity requirements of the policy setting.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Password characters should be a combination of alphanumeric characters. Alphanumeric characters consist of letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and mathematical and other conventional symbols.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">See the implementation that follows for the exact characters referred to here:</p><ul><li>Passwords that contain letters, special characters, and numbers: <strong>ap1@52</strong></li><li>Passwords that contain only numbers: <strong>23698217</strong></li><li>Passwords that contain only special characters: <strong>&amp;*#@!(%)</strong></li><li>Passwords that contain letters and numbers: <strong>meet123</strong></li><li>Passwords that contain only letters: <strong>POTHMYDE</strong></li><li>Passwords that contain only letters and special characters: <strong>bob@&amp;ba</strong></li><li>Passwords that contain only special characters and numbers: <strong>123@$45&nbsp;</strong></li><li style="text-align: justify;">Passwords that contain only uppercase and lowercase letters, such as: <strong>RuNnEr</strong></li><li style="text-align: justify;">Passwords that contain more than 20 characters comprising a phrase: such as <strong>Hardtocrackveryeasily</strong></li><li style="text-align: justify;">Passwords that contain shortcut codes or acronyms, such as <strong>L8r_L8rNot2day</strong> (i.e., later, later, not today)</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Passwords that contain frequently used words specifying websites, such as <strong>ABT2_uz_AMZ!</strong> (i.e., about to use Amazon!)</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Passwords that contain the first letters of words of a long sentence, such as <strong>TffcievwMi16wiwdm5g</strong> (i.e., the first foreign country I ever visited was Mexico in 2016 when I was doing my 5th grade)</li></ul></div>
