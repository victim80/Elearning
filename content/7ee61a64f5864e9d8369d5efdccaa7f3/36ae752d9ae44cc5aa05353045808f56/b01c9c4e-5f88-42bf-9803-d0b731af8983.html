  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">When users log in to a Windows computer, a series of steps are performed for user authentication. The Windows OS authenticates its users with the help of three mechanisms (protocols) provided by Microsoft.</p><p><strong>Security Accounts Manager (SAM) Database</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Windows uses the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) database or Active Directory Database to manage user accounts and passwords in hashed format (a one-way hash). The system does not store the passwords in plaintext format but in a hashed format, to protect them from attacks. The system implements the SAM database as a registry file, and the Windows kernel obtains and keeps an exclusive filesystem lock on the SAM file. As this file consists of a filesystem lock, this provides some measure of security for the storage of passwords.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">It is not possible to copy the SAM file to another location in the case of online attacks. Because the system locks the SAM file with an exclusive filesystem lock, a user cannot copy or move it while Windows is running. The lock does not release until the system throws a blue screen exception, or the OS has shut down. However, to make the password hashes available for offline brute-force attacks, attackers can dump the on-disk contents of the SAM file using various techniques.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Even if hackers use subterfuge techniques to discover the contents, the encrypted keys with a one-way hash make it difficult to hack. In addition, some versions have a secondary key, which makes the encryption specific to that copy of the OS.</p><p><strong>NTLM Authentication</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">NT LAN Manager (NTLM) is a default authentication scheme that performs authentication using a challenge/response strategy. Because it does not rely on any official protocol specification, there is no guarantee that it works effectively in every situation. Furthermore, it has been used in some Windows installations, where it successfully worked. NTLM authentication consists of two protocols: NTLM authentication protocol and LAN Manager (LM) authentication protocol. These protocols use different hash methodologies to store users’ passwords in the SAM database.</p><p><strong>Kerberos Authentication</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Kerberos is a network authentication protocol that provides strong authentication for client/server applications through secret-key cryptography. This protocol provides mutual authentication, in that both the server and the user verify each other’s identity. Messages sent through Kerberos protocol are protected against replay attacks and eavesdropping.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Kerberos employs the Key Distribution Center (KDC), which is a trusted third party. This consists of two logically distinct parts: an authentication server (AS) and a ticket-granting server (TGS). Kerberos uses “tickets” to prove a user’s identity.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Microsoft has upgraded its default authentication protocol to Kerberos, which provides a stronger authentication for client/server applications than NTLM.</p></div>
