  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">When two parties are communicating, a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack can take place, in which a third party intercepts a communication between the two parties without their knowledge. The third party eavesdrops on the traffic and then passes it along. To do this, the “man in the middle” has to sniff from both sides of the connection simultaneously. In an MITM attack, the attacker acquires access to the communication channels between the victim and server to extract the information. This type of attack is often used in telnet and wireless technologies. It is not easy to implement such attacks owing to the TCP sequence numbers and the speed of the communication. This method is relatively hard to perpetrate and can sometimes be broken by invalidating the traffic.</p></div>
