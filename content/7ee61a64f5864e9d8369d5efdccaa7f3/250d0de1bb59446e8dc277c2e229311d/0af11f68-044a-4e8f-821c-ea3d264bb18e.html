  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p><strong>Dictionary Attack</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">In this type of attack, a dictionary file is loaded into a cracking application that runs against user accounts. This dictionary is a text file that contains several dictionary words commonly used as passwords. The program uses every word present in the dictionary to find the password. In addition to a standard dictionary, an attackers’ dictionaries contain entries with numbers and symbols added to words (e.g., “3December!962”). Simple keyboard finger rolls (“qwer0987”), which many believe to produce random and secure passwords, are thus included in such a dictionary. Dictionary attacks are more useful than brute-force attacks, however, the former cannot be performed in systems using passphrases.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>This attack is applicable in two situations:</strong></p><ul><li>In cryptanalysis, to discover the decryption key for obtaining the plaintext from a ciphertext</li><li>In computer security, to bypass authentication and access the control mechanism of the computer by guessing passwords</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Methods to improve the success of a dictionary attack:</strong></p><ul><li>Use of several different dictionaries, such as technical and foreign dictionaries, which increases the number of possibilities</li><li>Use of string manipulation along with the dictionary (e.g., if the dictionary contains the word “system,” string manipulation creates anagrams like “metsys,” among others)</li></ul><p><strong>Brute-Force Attack</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">In a brute-force attack, attackers try every combination of characters until the password is broken. Cryptographic algorithms must be sufficiently hardened to prevent a brute-force attack, which is defined by the RSA as follows: “Exhaustive key-search, or brute-force search, is the basic technique for trying every possible key in turn until the correct key is identified.”</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A brute-force attack is when someone tries to produce every single encryption key for data to detect the needed information. Even today, only those with enough processing power could successfully perform this type of attack.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Cryptanalysis is a brute-force attack on encryption that employs a search of the keyspace. In other words, testing all possible keys is one of the attempts to recover the plaintext used to produce a particular ciphertext. The detection of a key or plaintext that is faster than a brute-force attack is one way of breaking the cipher. A cipher is secure if no method exists to break it other than a brute-force attack. In general, all ciphers are deficient in mathematical proof of security. If the user chooses keys randomly or searches randomly, the plaintext will become available on average after the system has tried half of all the possible keys.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the considerations for brute-force attacks are as follows:</p><ul><li>It is a time-consuming process</li><li>All passwords will eventually be found</li></ul><p><strong>Rule-based Attack</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers use this type of attack when they obtain some information about the password. This is a more powerful attack than dictionary and brute-force attacks because the cracker knows the password type. For example, if the attacker knows that the password contains a two- or three-digit number, he/she can use some specific techniques to extract the password quickly.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">By obtaining useful information, such as the method in which numbers and/or special characters have been used, and password length, attackers can minimize the time required to crack the password and therefore enhance the cracking tool. This technique involves brute force, a dictionary, and syllable attacks.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For online password-cracking attacks, an attacker will sometimes use a combination of both brute force and a dictionary. This combination falls into the categories of hybrid and syllable password-cracking attacks.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hybrid Attack</strong>: This type of attack depends on the dictionary attack. Often, people change their passwords merely by adding some numbers to their old passwords. In this case, the program would add some numbers and symbols to the words from the dictionary to try to crack the password. For example, if the old password is “system,” then there is a chance that the person will change it to “system1” or “system2.”</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Syllable Attack</strong>: Hackers use this cracking technique when passwords are not known words. Attackers use the dictionary and other methods to crack them, as well as all possible combinations of them.</li></ul></div>
