This method is relatively hard to perpetrate and computationally complicated. This is because a network with a hub implements a broadcast medium that all systems share on the LAN. The LAN sends the data to all machines connected to it. If an attacker runs a sniffer on one system on the LAN, he/she can gather data sent to and from any other system on the LAN. The majority of sniffer tools are ideally suited to sniff data in a hub environment. These tools are passive sniffers, as they passively wait for data transfer before capturing the information. They are efficient at imperceptibly gathering data from the LAN. The captured data may include passwords sent to remote systems during FTP, rlogin sessions, and electronic mail. The attacker uses these sniffed credentials to gain unauthorized access to the target system. There are a variety of tools available on the Internet for passive wire sniffing.</p></div>
