  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Password guessing is a password-cracking technique that involves attempting to log on to the target system with different passwords manually. Guessing is the key element of manual password cracking. The attacker creates a list of all possible passwords from the information collected through social engineering or any other method and tries them manually on the victimâ€™s machine to crack the passwords.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are the steps involved in password guessing:</p><ul><li>Find a valid user</li><li>Create a list of possible passwords</li><li>Rank passwords from high to low probability</li><li>Key in each password, until the correct password is discovered</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">Hackers can crack passwords manually or by using automated tools, methods, and algorithms. They can also automate password cracking using a simple FOR loop or create a script file that tries each password in a list. These techniques are still considered manual cracking. The failure rate of this type of attack is high.</p></div>
