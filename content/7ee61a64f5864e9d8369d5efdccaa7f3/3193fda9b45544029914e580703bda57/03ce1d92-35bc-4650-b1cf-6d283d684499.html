  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Password cracking is one of the crucial stages of system hacking. Password-cracking mechanisms often exploit otherwise legal means to gain unauthorized system access, such as recovering a user’s forgotten password.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Classification of password attacks depends on the attacker’s actions, which are of the following four types:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Non-Electronic Attacks</strong>: This is, for most cases, the attacker’s first attempt at gaining target system passwords. Non-electronic or non-technical attacks do not require any technical knowledge about hacking or system exploitation. Techniques used to perform non-electronic attacks include shoulder surfing, social engineering, dumpster diving, etc.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Active Online Attack</strong><strong>s</strong>: This is one of the easiest ways to gain unauthorized administrator-level system access. Here, the attacker communicates with the target machine to gain password access. Techniques used to perform active online attacks include password guessing, dictionary and brute-forcing attacks, hash injection, LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning, use of Trojans/spyware/keyloggers, internal monologue attacks, Markov-chain attacks, Kerberos password cracking, etc.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Passive Online Attacks</strong>: A passive attack is a type of system attack that does not lead to any changes in the system. In this attack, the attacker does not have to communicate with the system, but passively monitor or record the data passing over the communication channel, to and from the system. The data are then used to break into the system. Techniques used to perform passive online attacks include wire sniffing, man-in-the-middle attacks, replay attacks, etc.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Offline Attacks</strong>: Offline attacks refer to password attacks in which an attacker tries to recover cleartext passwords from a password hash dump. Offline attacks are often time-consuming but have a high success rate, as the password hashes can be reversed owing to their small keyspace and short length. Attackers use pre-computed hashes from rainbow tables to perform offline and distributed network attacks.</li></ul></div>
