  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">LLMNR (Link Local Multicast Name Resolution) and NBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Service) are two main elements of Windows OSs used to perform name resolution for hosts present on the same link. These services are enabled by default in Windows OSs.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">When the DNS server fails to resolve name queries, the host performs an unauthenticated UDP broadcast asking all the hosts if anyone has a name that it is looking for. As the host trying to connect is following an unauthenticated and broadcast process, it becomes easy for an attacker to passively listen to a network for LLMNR (UDP port 5355) and NBT-NS (UDP port 137) broadcasts and respond to the request pretending to be a target host. After accepting a connection with a host, the attacker can utilize tools such as Responder.py or Metasploit to forward the request to a rogue server (for instance, TCP: 137) to perform an authentication process.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">During the authentication process, the attacker sends an NTLMv2 hash to the rogue server, which was obtained from the host trying to authenticate itself. This hash is stored in a disk and can be cracked using offline hash-cracking tools such as hashcat or John the Ripper. Once cracked, these credentials can be used to log in and gain access to the legitimate host system.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Steps involved in LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning</strong>:</p><ol><li>The user sends a request to connect to the data-sharing system, \\DataServer, which she mistakenly typed as \\DtaServr.</li><li>The \\DataServer responds to the user, saying that it does not know the host named \\DtaServr.</li><li>The user then performs a LLMNR/NBT-NS broadcast to find out if anyone in the network knows the host name\\DtaServr.</li><li>The attacker replies to the user saying that it is \\DataServer, accepts the user NTLMv2 hash, and responds to the user with an error.</li></ol></div>
