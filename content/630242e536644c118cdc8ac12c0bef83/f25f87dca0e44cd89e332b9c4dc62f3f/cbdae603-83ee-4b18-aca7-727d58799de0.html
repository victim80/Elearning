  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Discussed below are some threats to cloud computing:</p><p><strong>Data Breach/Loss</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">An improperly designed cloud computing environment with multiple clients is at high risk of a data breach because a flaw in one client’s application can allow attackers to access other client’s data. Data loss or leakage is highly dependent on cloud architecture and operation.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Data loss issues include the following:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Data is erased, modified, or decoupled (lost).</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Encryption keys are lost, misplaced, or stolen.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Data are accessed illegally owing to improper authentication, authorization, and access controls.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Data is misused by the CSP.</li></ul><p><strong>Abuse and Nefarious Use of Cloud Services</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The presence of weak registration systems in the cloud-computing environment may allow attackers to create anonymous access to cloud services and perpetrate various attacks, such as password and critical cracking, building rainbow tables, CAPTCHA-solving farms, launching dynamic attack points, hosting exploits on cloud platforms, hosting malicious data, Botnet command or control, and DDoS.</p><p><strong>Insecure Interfaces and APIs</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Interfaces or APIs enable customers to manage and interact with cloud services. Cloud service models must be security integrated, and users must be aware of security risks in the use, implementation, and monitoring of such services. Insecure interfaces and APIs risks include the following:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Circumvents user-defined policies</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Non-credential leakproof</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Breach in logging and monitoring facilities</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Unknown API dependencies</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Reusable passwords/tokens</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Insufficient input-data validation</li></ul><p><strong>Insufficient Due Diligence</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Ignorance of CSP’s cloud environment poses risks in operational responsibilities such as security, encryption, incident response, and more such problems as contractual issues, design, and architectural issues.</p><p><strong>Shared Technology Issues</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">IaaS vendors share the infrastructure to deliver services in a scalable way. Most underlying infrastructure components (e.g., GPU, CPU caches) do not offer substantial isolation properties in a multi-tenant environment. This enables attackers to attack other machines if they can exploit vulnerabilities in one client’s applications. To address this gap, virtualization hypervisors mediate access between guest OSs and the physical resources that might contain loopholes allowing hackers to gain unauthorized control over the underlying platforms.</p><p><strong>Unknown Risk Profile</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Software updates, threat analysis, intrusion detection, security practices, and various other components determine the security posture of an organization. Client organizations are unable to get a clear picture of internal security procedures, security compliance, configuration hardening, patching, auditing and logging, etc. because they are less involved with hardware and software ownership and maintenance in the cloud. However, organizations must be aware of issues such as internal security procedures, security compliance, configuration hardening, patching, and auditing and logging.</p><p><strong>Unsynchronized System Clocks</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The failure of synchronizing clocks at the end systems can affect the working of automated tasks. For example, if the cloud computing devices do not have synchronized or matched times, then timestamp inaccuracy constitutes the network administrator unable to analyze the log files for any malicious activity accurately. Unsynchronized clocks can cause various other problems; e.g., in case of money transactions or database backups, the mismatched timestamp may result in significant problems or discrepancies.</p><p><strong>Inadequate Infrastructure Design and Planning</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">An agreement between the CSP and customer states the quality of service that the CSP offers, such as downtime, physical and network-based redundancies, standard data backup and restore processes, and availability periods.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">At times, CSPs may not satisfy the rapid rise in demand owing to a shortage of computing resources and/or poor network design (e.g., traffic flows through a single point, even though the necessary hardware is available), giving rise to unacceptable network latency or inability to meet agreed service levels.</p><p><strong>Conflicts between Client Hardening Procedures and Cloud Environment</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Certain client hardening procedures may conflict with a CSP environment, making implementation by the client impossible. Because a cloud is a multi-tenant environment, the colocation of many customers indeed causes conflicts for the cloud providers, as communication security requirements are likely to diverge between customers.</p><p><strong>Loss of Operational and Security Logs</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The loss of operational logs makes it challenging to evaluate operational variables. The options for solving issues are limited when no data is available for analysis. The loss of security logs poses a risk for managing the implementation of the information security management program. Loss of security logs may occur in case of storage under-provisioning.</p><p><strong>Malicious Insiders</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Malicious insiders are disgruntled current/former employees, contractors, or other business partners who have/had authorized access to cloud resources and could intentionally exceed or misuse that access to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the organization information. Malicious insiders who have authorized access to cloud resources can abuse their access to compromise the information available in the cloud. Threats include loss of reputation, productivity, and financial theft.</p><p><strong>Illegal Access to the Cloud</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Weak authentication and authorization controls may lead to unlawful access, thereby compromising confidential and critical data stored in the cloud.</p><p><strong>Loss of Business Reputation due to Co-tenant Activities</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">This threat arises because of the lack of resource and reputational isolation, vulnerabilities in the hypervisors, etc. Resources are shared in the cloud, thus the malicious activity of one co-tenant might affect the reputation of the other, resulting in poor service delivery, data loss, etc. that bring down the reputation of the organization.</p><p><strong>Privilege Escalation</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Mistakes in the access allocation system, such as coding errors and design flaws, can result in a customer, third party, or employee obtaining more access rights than required. This threat arises because of authentication, authorization, and accountability vulnerabilities, user-provisioning and de-provisioning vulnerabilities, hypervisor vulnerabilities, unclear roles and responsibilities, misconfiguration, etc.</p><p><strong>Natural Disasters</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Based on geographic location and climate, data centers may be exposed to natural disasters, such as floods, lightning, and earthquakes, which can affect cloud services.</p><p><strong>Hardware Failure</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Hardware failures, such as switches, servers, routers, access points, hard disks, network cards, and processors in data centers, can make cloud data inaccessible. The majority of hardware failures occur because of hard disk problems. Hard disk failures take a lot of time to track and fix because of their low-level complexities. Hardware failure can lead to poor performance delivery to end-users and damage the business.</p><p><strong>Supply Chain Failure</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">A supply chain failure can be caused by incomplete and non-transparent terms of use, hidden dependencies created by cross-cloud applications, inappropriate CSP selection, lack of supplier redundancy, etc. Cloud providers outsource certain tasks to third parties. Thus, the security of the cloud is directly proportional to the security of each link and the extent of dependency on third parties. A disruption in the chain may lead to loss of data privacy and integrity, services unavailability, violation of the SLA, economic and reputational losses failing to meet customer demand, and cascading failure.</p><p><strong>Modifying Network Traffic</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">In the cloud, the network traffic may be altered owing to flaws during provisioning or de-provisioning networks, or vulnerabilities in communication encryption. Modification of network traffic may cause loss, alteration, or theft of confidential data and communications.</p><p><strong>Isolation Failure</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Multi-tenancy and shared resources are the characteristics of cloud computing. Strong isolation or compartmentalization of storage, memory, routing, and reputation among different tenants is lacking. Because of isolation failure, attackers attempt to control operations of other cloud customers to gain illegal access to the data.</p><p><strong>Cloud Provider Acquisition&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">CSP acquisition may increase the probability of tactical shift and affect non-binding agreements at risk. This could pose a challenge in handling security requirements.</p><p><strong>Management Interface Compromise&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Customer management interfaces of cloud providers facilitate access to a large number of resources over the Internet. This enhances security risks, particularly when combined with remote access and web browser vulnerabilities. Management interface compromise arises from improper configuration, system and application vulnerabilities, remote access to the management interface, etc.</p><p><strong>Network Management Failure&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Poor network management leads to network congestion, misconnection, misconfiguration, lack of resource isolation, etc., which affect services and security.</p><p><strong>Authentication Attacks</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Weak authentication mechanisms (weak passwords, password re-use, etc.) and the inherent limitations of one-factor authentication mechanisms allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to cloud computing systems.</p><p><strong>VM-Level Attacks</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Cloud computing extensively uses virtualization technologies offered by several vendors, including VMware, Xen, Virtual Box, and vSphere. Threats to these technologies arise from vulnerabilities in the hypervisors.</p><p><strong>Lock-in</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Lock-in reflects the inability of the client to migrate from one CSP to another or in-house systems owing to the lack of tools, procedures, standard data formats, applications, and service portability. This threat is related to the inappropriate selection of a CSP, incomplete and non-transparent terms of use, lack of standard mechanisms, etc.</p><p><strong>Licensing Risks</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The organization may incur a substantial licensing fee if the CSP charges the software deployed in the cloud on a per-instance basis. Therefore, the organization should always retain ownership over its software assets located in the cloud provider environment. Risks to licensing occur because of incomplete and non-transparent terms of use.</p><p><strong>Loss of Governance</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">In using cloud infrastructure, customers bestow control to CSPs regarding issues that could affect security. Furthermore, SLAs may not commit the CSP to provide such services, thus leaving a gap in security defenses. This threat results from unclearness of roles and responsibilities, lack of vulnerability assessment processes, conflicting promises in SLAs, lack of certification schemes and jurisdiction, and unavailability of the audit, among others.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Loss of governance results in noncompliance with security requirements, lack of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, poor performance and quality of service, etc.</p><p><strong>Loss of Encryption Keys</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The loss of encryption keys required for secure communication or systems access provides potential attackers with the possibility to get unauthorized assets. This threat arises from the poor key management and generation techniques.</p><p><strong>Risks from Changes of Jurisdiction</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Clouds may store the customer data in multiple jurisdictions, of which some may be high risk. Local authorities in high-risk countries (e.g., countries without the rule of law, with an unpredictable legal framework and enforcement or autocratic police states) could raid data centers; the data or information system could be subjected to enforced disclosure or seizure. Changes in the jurisdiction of data may lead to the blockage or impoundment of the information system by the government or other organizations. Customers should consider jurisdictional ambiguities before adopting a cloud, as local laws for data storage could provide government access to private data.</p><p><strong>Undertaking Malicious Probes or Scans</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Malicious probes or scanning allows attackers to collect sensitive information that may lead to loss of confidentiality and integrity, and availability of services and data.</p><p><strong>Theft of Computer Equipment</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The theft of equipment may occur owing to inadequate controls on physical parameters, such as smart card access at entry, which may lead to loss of physical equipment and sensitive data.</p><p><strong>Cloud Service Termination or Failure</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Termination of cloud service because of non-profitability or disputes may lead to data loss, unless end-users protect themselves legally. Many factors, such as competitive pressure, lack of financial support, and inadequate business strategies, can lead to termination or failure of the cloud service. This threat results in poor delivery and quality of service and loss of investment. Furthermore, failures in the services outsourced to the CSP may affect its ability to meet duties and commitments to its customers.</p><p><strong>Subpoena and E-Discovery</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Customer data and services are subjected to a cease request from authorities or third parties. This threat occurs owing to improper resource isolation, data storage in multiple jurisdictions, and lack of insight on jurisdictions.</p><p><strong>Improper Data Handling and Disposal</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">It is difficult to ascertain data handling and disposal procedures followed by CSPs owing to limited access to cloud infrastructure. When clients request data deletion, data may not be truly wiped because</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Multiple copies of data are stored, even if they are unavailable.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">The disk to be destroyed might also contain the data of other clients.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Multi-tenancy and reuse of hardware resources in the cloud keeps client data at risk.</li></ul><p><strong>Loss/Modification of Backup Data</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and insecure user behavior (e.g., storing or reusing passwords) to gain illegal access to the data backups in the cloud. After gaining access, attackers might delete or modify the data stored in the databases. Lack of data restoration procedures in case of backup data loss puts the service levels at risk.</p><p><strong>Compliance Risks</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Organizations that seek to obtain compliance with standards and laws may be at risk if the CSP cannot provide evidence of their compliance with the requirements, is outsourcing cloud management to third parties, and/or does not permit audit by the client. Compliance risks arise from the lack of governance over audits and industry-standard assessments. Thus, clients are unaware of the processes, procedures, and practices of providers regarding accessibility, identity management, and segregation of duties.</p><p><strong>Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS)</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The payment method in a cloud system is “<strong>No use, no bill</strong>”; when customers make requests, the CSP charges them according to the recorded data, the duration of requests, the amount of data transfer in the network, and the number of CPU cycles consumed. Economic denial of service destroys financial resources; in the worst case, this could lead to customer bankruptcy or other serious economic impact. If an attacker engages the cloud server with a malicious service or executes a malicious code that consumes much computational power and storage, the legitimate account holder is charged until the primary cause of CPU usage is detected.</p><p><strong>Lack of Security Architecture</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Most of the companies are migrating their IT capabilities to the public cloud, so incorporating appropriate security strategies to thwart against cyber threats is a major challenge. It is important to develop appropriate security architectures and strategies before migrating IT infrastructure to the cloud.</p><p><strong>Hijacking Accounts</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">A highly critical threat to organizations is the compromise of employee accounts on the cloud. If an attacker gains access to the cloud by compromising a user account, they can gain access to all information stored on the cloud servers without leaving any trace. Attackers use techniques such as phishing and password cracking to gain user credentials. These attacks severely impact business operations causing reputational damage, degradation of brand value, disclosure of sensitive information, etc.</p></div>
