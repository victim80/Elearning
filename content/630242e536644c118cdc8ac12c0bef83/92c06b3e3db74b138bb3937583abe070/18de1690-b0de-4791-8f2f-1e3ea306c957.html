  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Docker is an open-source technology used for developing, packaging, and running applications. All Docker dependencies are in the form of containers to ensure that applications work in a seamless environment. Docker provides a PaaS through OS-level virtualization and delivers containerized software packages. This technology isolates applications from the underlying infrastructure for faster software delivery. The benefit of Docker is that when an application is packaged along with its dependencies into a Docker container, it can run in any environment. Furthermore, when developers build applications using Docker, they are assured that there will be no interference between them because Docker containers are isolated from each other and communicate via well-defined channels.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Docker Engine</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The Docker engine is a client/server application installed on a host that allows to develop, deploy, and run applications using the following components:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Server</strong>: It is a persistent back-end process, also known as a daemon process (dockerd command).</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Rest API</strong>: This API allows the communication and assignment of tasks to the daemon.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Client CLI</strong>: It is the command-line interface used to communicate with the daemon and where various Docker commands are initiated.</li></ul></div>
