Docker CLI is used for creating a swarm, deploying an application to the swarm, and handling its activity or behavior.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The swarm mode enables administrators and developers to</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Communicate with containers and assign jobs to different containers</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Expand or reduce the number of containers based on the load</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Carry out a health check and handle the lifecycle of different containers</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Dispense failover and redundancy to continue a process even if node failure occurs</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Perform timely software updates to all containers</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Docker Architecture</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The Docker architecture employs a client/server model and consists of various components, such as the host, client, network, registry, and other storage units. The Docker client interacts with the Docker daemon, which develops, runs, and distributes the containers. The Daemon and Docker clients can carry out operations on the same host; alternatively, users can connect the Docker client to remote daemons. The communication between the Docker client and the Docker server daemon is established via REST API.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Discussed below are the various components of the Docker architecture:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Docker Daemon</strong>: The Docker daemon (<strong>dockerd</strong>) processes the API requests and handles various Docker objects, such as containers, volumes, images, and networks.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Docker Client</strong>: It is the primary interface through which users communicate with Docker. When commands such as <strong>docker run</strong> are initiated, the client passes related commands to <strong>dockerd</strong>, which then executes them. Docker commands use the Docker API for communication.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Docker Registries</strong>: Docker registries are locations where images are stored and pulled, and can be either private or public. Docker Cloud and Docker Hub are two popular public registries. Docker Hub is a predefined location of Docker images, which can be used by all users.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Docker Objects</strong>: Docker objects are used to assemble an application. The most important Docker objects are as follows:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Images</strong>: Images are used to store and deploy containers. They are read-only binary templates with instructions for container creation.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Containers</strong>: Application resources run inside the containers. A container is a runnable instance of an application image. Docker CLI or API is used to create, launch, stop, and destroy these containers.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Services</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Services enable users to extend the number of containers across daemons, and together they serve as a swarm with several managers and workers. Each swarm member is a daemon, and all these daemons can interact with each other using Docker API.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Networking</strong>: It is a channel through which all isolated containers communicate.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Volumes</strong>: It is a storage where persisting data created by Docker and used by Docker containers are stored.</li></ul></div>
