These master components can be executed by any computer in the cluster.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Kube-apiserver</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The API server is an integral part of the Kubernetes control panel that responds to all API requests. It serves as a front-end utility for the control panel and it is the only component that interacts with the etcd cluster and ensures data storage.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Etcd cluster</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>It is a distributed and consistent key-value storage where Kubernetes cluster data, service discovery details, API objects, etc. are stored.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Kube-scheduler</strong>: Kube-scheduler is a master component that scans newly generated pods and allocates a node for them. It assigns the nodes based on factors such as the overall resource requirement, data locality, software/hardware/policy restrictions, and internal workload interventions.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Kube-controller-manager</strong>: Kube-controller-manager is a master component that runs controllers. Controllers are generally individual processes (e.g., node controller, endpoint controller, replication controller, service account and token controller) but are combined into a single binary and run together in a single process to reduce complexity.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>cloud-controller-manager</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>This is the master component used to run controllers that communicate with cloud providers. Cloud-controller-manager enables the Kubernetes code and cloud provider code to evolve separately.</li></ul><p><strong>Node components</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Node or worker components run on each node in the cluster, managing working pods and supplying the Kubernetes runtime services.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Kubelet</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Kubelet is an important service agent that runs on each node and ensures containers running in a pod. It also ensures pods and containers are healthy and running as expected. Kubelet does not handle containers that are not generated by Kubernetes.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Kube-proxy</strong>: It is a network proxy service that also runs on every worker node. This service maintains the network rules that enable network connection to the pods.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Container Runtime</strong>: Container runtime is a software designed to run the containers. Kurbernetes supports various container runtimes, such as Docker, rktlet, containerd, and cri-o.</li></ul></div>
