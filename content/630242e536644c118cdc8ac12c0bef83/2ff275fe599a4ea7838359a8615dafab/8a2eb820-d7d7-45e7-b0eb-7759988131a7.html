  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Discussed below are various attack methods performed on the cloud computing environment.</p><h3>Side-Channel Attacks or Cross-guest VM Breaches</h3><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers can compromise the cloud by placing a malicious virtual machine near a target cloud server and then launch a side-channel attack. The below figure shows how an attacker can compromise the cloud by placing a malicious VM near a target cloud server. The attacker runs the VM on the same physical host as the target VM and takes advantage of the shared physical resources (processor cache). Then, he launches side-channel attacks (timing attack, data remanence, acoustic cryptanalysis, power monitoring attack, and differential fault analysis) to extract cryptographic keys/plain text secrets to steal the victimâ€™s credentials. Side-channel attacks can be implemented by any co-resident user and are mainly related to vulnerabilities in shared technology resources. Finally, the attacker uses the stolen credentials to impersonate the victim.</p></div>
