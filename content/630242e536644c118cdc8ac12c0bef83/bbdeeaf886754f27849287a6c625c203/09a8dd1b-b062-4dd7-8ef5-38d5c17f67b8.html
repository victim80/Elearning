  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Docker allows connecting multiple containers and services or other non-Docker workloads together. It can manage Docker hosts running on multiple platforms, such as Linux and Windows, in a platform-independent way. The Docker networking architecture is developed on a set of interfaces known as the container network model (CNM), which provides application portability across heterogeneous infrastructures.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The CNM includes multiple high-level constructs as discussed below:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sandbox</strong>: Sandbox comprises the container network stack configuration for the management of container interfaces, routing tables, and domain name system (DNS) settings.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Endpoint</strong>: To maintain application portability, an endpoint is connected to a network and is abstracted away from the application, so that services can implement different network drivers.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Network</strong>: A network is an interconnected collection of endpoints. Endpoints that do not have network connection cannot communicate over the network.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">The CNM includes two pluggable driver interfaces to provide additional functionality and control over the network.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Network Drivers</strong>: The network functions through the implementation of Docker network drivers. These drivers are pluggable so that multiple network drivers can be used concurrently on the same network. There are two types of CNM network drivers: namely native and remote network drivers.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>IPAM Drivers</strong>: IP address management (IPAM) drivers assign default subnet and IP addresses to the endpoints and networks, if they are not assigned.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">Docker engine includes five native network drivers, as discussed below:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Host</strong>: By using a host driver, a container implements the host networking stack.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Bridge</strong>: A bridge driver is used to create a Linux bridge on the host that is managed by the Docker.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Overlay</strong>: An overlay driver is used to enable container communication over the physical network infrastructure.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>MACVLAN</strong>: A macvlan driver is used to create a network connection between container interfaces and the parent host interface or sub-interfaces using the Linux MACVLAN bridge mode.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>None</strong>: A none driver implements its own networking stack and is isolated completely from the host networking stack.</li></ul></div>
