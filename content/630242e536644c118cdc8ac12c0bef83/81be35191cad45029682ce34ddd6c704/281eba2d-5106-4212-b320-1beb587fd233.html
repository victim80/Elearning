  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Monolithic applications are broken down into cloud-hosted sub-applications, called microservices, that work together, each performing a unique task. Microservices divide and distribute the application workload, providing stable, seamless, and scalable services by interacting with each other. Monolithic applications are decomposed around business capabilities supporting cross-functional teams to develop, support, and deploy microservices. Compared to traditional data storage models used by monolithic applications, microservices decentralize the data storage by managing their own data stores. Developers create a Docker container for each microservice. As each microservice is packaged into the container along with the required libraries, frameworks, and configuration files, microservices belonging to a single application can be developed and managed using multiple platforms.</p></div>
