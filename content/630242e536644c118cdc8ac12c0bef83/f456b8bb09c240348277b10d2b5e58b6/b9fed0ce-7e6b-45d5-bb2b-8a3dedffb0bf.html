  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Cloudborne is a vulnerability residing in a bare-metal cloud server that enables attackers to implant malicious backdoor in its firmware. The installed backdoor can persist even if the server is reallocated to new clients or businesses that use it as an IaaS. Physical servers are not confined to one client and can be moved from one client to another. During the reclamation process, if the firmware re-flash (factory default setting, complete erase of memory, etc.) is not properly implemented, the backdoors can stay active on the firmware and travel along the server.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in super-micro hardware to overwrite the firmware in the baseboard management control (BMC) of a bare-metal server that is used for remote management activities, such as provisioning, reinstalling the operating system, and troubleshooting via the intelligent platform management interface (IPMI) without physical access. As the BMC has the power to control the servers remotely and provision the system to the new customers, attackers choose it as a primary target. Vulnerabilities in the bare-metal cloud server and inappropriate firmware re-flashing can pave the way for attackers to install and maintain backdoor persistence. Then, the malicious backdoors allow attackers to directly access the hardware and bypass the security mechanisms to perform activities such as monitoring new customerâ€™s activities, disabling the application/server, and intercepting the data. &nbsp;These activities allow attackers to launch ransomware attacks on the target.</p></div>
