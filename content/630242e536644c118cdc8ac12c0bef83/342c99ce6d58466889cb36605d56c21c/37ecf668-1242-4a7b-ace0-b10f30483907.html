  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">As discussed above, Docker is an open-source software that can be installed on any host to build, deploy, and run containerized applications on a single operating system. Containerization isolates running applications from other services and applications running on the host OS. Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that automates the process of creating, managing, updating, scaling, and destroying containers. Both Dockers and Kubernetes are based on microservices architecture, they are built using the Go programming language to deploy small lightweight binaries, and use the YAML file for specifying application configurations and stacks. When Kubernetes and Docker are coupled together, they provide efficient management and deployment of containers in a distributed architecture. When Docker is installed on multiple hosts with different operating systems, you can use Kubernetes to manage these Docker hosts through container provisioning, load balancing, failover and scaling, and security.</p></div>
