  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A wrapping attack is performed during the translation of the SOAP message in the TLS layer, where attackers duplicate the body of the message and send it to the server as a legitimate user. As shown in the below figure, when users send a request from their VM through a browser, the request first reaches the web server. Then, a SOAP message containing structural information is generated and exchanged with the browser during the passing of the message. Before the message passing occurs, the browser needs to sign the XML document and canonicalize it. Additionally, it should append the signature values to the document. Finally, the SOAP header should contain the necessary information for the destination after computation.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In a wrapping attack, the adversary deception occurs during the translation of the SOAP message in the TLS. The attacker duplicates the body of the message and sends it to the server as a legitimate user. The server checks the authentication through the signature value (which is also duplicated) and verifies its integrity. As a result, the adversary can intrude in the cloud and run malicious code to interrupt the usual functioning of the cloud servers.</p></div>
