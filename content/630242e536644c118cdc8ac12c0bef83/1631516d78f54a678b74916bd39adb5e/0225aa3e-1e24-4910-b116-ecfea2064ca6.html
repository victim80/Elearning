  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">MITC attacks are an advanced version of MITM attacks. In MITM attacks, an attacker uses an exploit that intercepts and manipulates the communication between two parties, while MITC attacks are carried out by abusing cloud file synchronization services, such as Google Drive or DropBox, for data compromise, command and control (C&amp;C), data exfiltration, and remote access. Synchronization tokens are used for application authentication in the cloud but cannot distinguish malicious traffic from normal traffic. Attackers abuse this weakness in cloud accounts to perform MITC attacks.</p></div>
