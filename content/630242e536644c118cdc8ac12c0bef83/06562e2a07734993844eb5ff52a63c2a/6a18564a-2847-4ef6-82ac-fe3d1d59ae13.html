  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A container is a package of an application/software including all its dependencies, such as library and configuration files, binaries, and other resources that run independently from other processes in the cloud environment. All these resource files are delivered as a unit to solve compatibility issues when applications are moved between cloud environments. These containers are provided to the subscribers in the form of a CaaS. A CaaS service includes the virtualization and management of containers through orchestrators. Using these services, subscribers can develop rich, scalable containerized applications through the cloud or on-site data centers. It inherits features of both IaaS and PaaS. Popular container services include Amazon AWS EC2, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Docker, etc.</p><h4 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Features:</strong></h4><p style="text-align:justify;">The implementation of containers offers many benefits, making them an attractive technology to various industries. Discussed below are some of their most important features:</p><p><strong>Portability and consistency</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">An application or software developed in a container includes all the resources required to perform. This portability helps clients or end-users run an application on various platforms and private or public cloud environments.</p><p><strong>Security</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Owing to the independent nature of containers, security risks are reduced. If an application is attacked or compromised, its infections do not extend across the remaining containers.</p><p><strong>High efficiency and cost effectiveness</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Containers can run with fewer resources compared to virtual machines (VMs) because they do not need independent operating systems. Additionally, containers need a few megabytes of memory to run, enabling users to run multiple containers on a single server. These containers are isolated in a cloud server because if an application is down for one container, other containers can utilize it without technical glitches.</p><p><strong>Scalability</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Containers are scalable and enable subscribers or users to integrate more similar containers under the same cluster to increase their size. The smart scaling technology enables users to run only the intended container and put unwanted containers at rest, making it cost-effective.</p><p><strong>Robustness</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Containers can be generated, deployed, and destroyed in seconds because they do not require operating systems. This feature allows a quick development process, increased operational speed, and the launch of new software versions within the specified time. It also speeds up the userâ€™s experience with the application, making it easier for developers and organizations to quickly address bugs and integrate the latest features.</p><h4 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Container Technology Architecture</strong></h4><p style="text-align:justify;">As shown in the below figure, container technology has a five-tier architecture and undergoes a three-phase lifecycle:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tier-1</strong>: Developer machines - image creation, testing and accreditation</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tier-2</strong>: Testing and accreditation systems - verification and validation of image contents, signing images and sending them to the registries</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tier-3</strong>: Registries - storing images and disseminating images to the orchestrators based on requests</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tier-4</strong>: Orchestrators - transforming images into containers and deploying containers to hosts</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tier-5</strong>: Hosts - operating and managing containers as instructed by the orchestrator</li></ul></div>
