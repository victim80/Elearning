  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Organizations are widely adopting container-based platforms owing to their features (e.g., flexibility, continuous application delivery, efficient deployment). However, the rapid growth and propagation of container technology have resulted in many security challenges.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Discussed below are some of the challenges regarding container security:</p><p><strong>Inflow of vulnerable source code&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Containers constitute an open-source platform used by developers to regularly update, store, and use images in a repository. This results in an enormous uncontrolled code that may include vulnerabilities, which can compromise security.</p><p><strong>Large attack surface</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The host OS consists of many containers, applications, VMs, and databases in the cloud or on-premises. A large attack surface implies a large number of vulnerabilities and an increased difficulty in detecting them.</p><p><strong>Lack of visibility</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">A container engine runs the container, interfaces with the Linux kernel, and creates another layer of abstraction camouflaging the actions of the containers and making it difficult to track activities of specific containers or users.</p><p><strong>Compromising secrets</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Containers require sensitive information, such as API keys, usernames, or passwords, for accessing any services. Attackers who illicitly gain access to this sensitive information can compromise security.</p><p><strong>DevOps speed</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Containers can be executed promptly and, after execution, are stopped and removed. This fugitiveness helps attackers launch attacks and hide themselves without installing any malicious code.</p><p><strong>Noisy neighboring containers</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">A container may consume and exhaust all available system resources, which directly affects the operation of other neighboring containers creating a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.</p><p><strong>Container breakout to the host</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Containers that runs as root may break the containment and gain access to the host OS through privilege escalation.</p><p><strong>Network-based attacks</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers may exploit failed containers having active raw sockets and outbound network connections to launch various network-based attacks.</p><p><strong>Bypassing isolation</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers, after compromising the security of a container, may escalate privileges to gain access to other containers or the host itself.</p><p><strong>Ecosystem complexity</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Containers are built, deployed, and managed using multiple vendors and sources. This makes it complex to secure and update the individual components because they originate from different repositories.</p></div>
