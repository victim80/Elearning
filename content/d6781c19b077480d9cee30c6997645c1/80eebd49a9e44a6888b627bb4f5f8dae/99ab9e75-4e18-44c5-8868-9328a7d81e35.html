  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Text messaging is the most prevalent nonvoice communication on mobile phones. Users around the world send and receive billions of text messages daily. Such a massive amount of data entails an increase in spam or phishing attacks.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">SMS phishing (also known as SMiShing) is a type of phishing fraud in which an attacker uses SMS systems to send bogus text messages. It is the act of trying to acquire personal and financial information by sending SMS (or IM) containing deceptive links. Often, these bogus text messages contain a deceptive website URL or telephone number to lure victims into revealing their personal or financial information, such as SSNs, credit card numbers, and online banking username and password. In addition, attackers implement SMiShing to infect victims’ mobile phones and associated networks with malware.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers buy a prepaid SMS card using a fake identity. Then, they send an SMS bait to a user. The SMS may seem attractive or urgent. For example, it may include a lottery message, gift voucher, online purchase, or notification of account suspension, along with a malicious link or phone number. When the user clicks the link, considering it to be legitimate, he/she is redirected to the attacker’s phishing site, where he/she provides the requested information (e.g., name, phone number, date of birth, credit card number or PIN, CVV code, SNN, and email address). The attacker may use the acquired information to perform malicious activities such as identity theft, online purchases, and so on.</p></div>
