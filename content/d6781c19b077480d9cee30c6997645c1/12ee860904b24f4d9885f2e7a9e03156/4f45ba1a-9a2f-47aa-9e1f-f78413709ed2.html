  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <em>https://www.owasp.org</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;">According to OWASP, the following are the top 10 mobile risks:</p><p><strong>M1—Improper Platform Usage</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This category covers the misuse of a platform feature or the failure to use platform security controls. It includes Android intents, platform permissions, and the misuse of Touch ID, Keychain, or some other security control that is part of the mobile device’s OS. There are several ways in which mobile apps can be exposed to this risk.</p><p><strong>M2—Insecure Data Storage</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Insecure data storage vulnerability arises when development teams assume that users and malware will not have access to a mobile device’s file system and subsequently to sensitive information in the device’s data stores. “Jailbreaking” or rooting a mobile device bypasses encryption protection mechanisms. OWASP recommends analyzing platforms’ data security application programming interfaces (APIs) and calling them appropriately.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Unintended data leakage occurs when a developer unintentionally places sensitive data in a location on the mobile device that is easily accessible by other apps on the device. Such leakage is normally caused by vulnerabilities in the OS, frameworks, compiler environment, new hardware, and so on without a developer’s knowledge. It is a significant threat to the OS, platforms, and frameworks; thus, it is important to understand how they handle features such as URL caching, browser cookie objects, and HTML5 data storage.</p><p><strong>M3—Insecure Communication</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This category covers poor handshaking, incorrect SSL versions, weak negotiation, cleartext communication of sensitive assets, and so on. Such flaws expose an individual user’s data and can lead to account theft. If the adversary intercepts an admin account, the entire site could be exposed. A poor Secure Socket Layer (SSL) setup can also facilitate phishing and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.</p><p><strong>M4—Insecure Authentication</strong></p><p>This category captures notions of authenticating the end user or bad session management such as</p><ul><li>Failing to identify the user when it is required</li><li>Failure to maintain the user’s identity when it is required.</li><li>Weaknesses in session management.</li></ul><p><strong>M5—Insufficient Cryptography</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The code applies cryptography to a sensitive information asset. However, cryptography is insufficient in some ways. This category covers issues in which cryptography is attempted but not performed correctly. This vulnerability will result in the unauthorized retrieval of sensitive information from the mobile device. To exploit this weakness, an adversary must successfully convert encrypted code or sensitive data into its original unencrypted form due to weak encryption algorithms or flaws in the process of encryption.</p><p><strong>M6—Insecure Authorization</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This category captures failures in authorization (e.g., authorization decisions on the client side and forced browsing). It is distinct from authentication issues (e.g., device enrolment and user identification).</p><p style="text-align:justify;">When an app does not authenticate users at all in a situation where it should (e.g., granting anonymous access to some resource or service when authenticated and authorized access is required), then it is an authentication failure and not an authorization failure.</p><p><strong>M7—Client Code Quality</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This category covers “Security Decisions via Untrusted Inputs” and is one of the less frequently used categories. It is the catch-all for code-level implementation problems in the mobile client, which are distinct from server-side coding mistakes. It captures buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and various other code-level mistakes where the solution is to rewrite some code that is running on the mobile device. Most exploitations that fall into this category result in foreign code execution or DoS on remote server endpoints (and not the mobile device itself).</p><p><strong>M8—Code Tampering</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This category covers binary patching, local resource modification, method hooking, method swizzling, and dynamic memory modification.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Once an application is delivered to a mobile device, its code and data resources are resident on the device. An attacker can directly modify the code, change the memory contents dynamically, change or replace the system APIs that the application uses, or modify the application’s data and resources. Thus, the attacker can directly subvert the intended use of the software for personal or monetary gain.</p><p><strong>M9—Reverse Engineering</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This category includes the analysis of the final core binary to determine its source code, libraries, algorithms, and other assets. Software such as IDA Pro, Hopper, otool, and other binary inspection tools give the attacker insights into the inner workings of the application. Thus, he/she may exploit other nascent vulnerabilities in the application and uncover information about backend servers, cryptographic constants and ciphers, and intellectual property.</p><p><strong>M10—Extraneous Functionality</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Often, developers include hidden backdoor functionality or other internal development security controls that are not intended to be released into a production environment. For example, a developer may accidentally include a password as a comment in a hybrid app. Another example involves the disabling of two-factor authentication during testing.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Typically, an attacker seeks to understand extraneous functionality within a mobile app to discover hidden functionality in the backend systems. Attackers will typically exploit such extraneous functionality directly from their own systems without any involvement by the end users.</p></div>
