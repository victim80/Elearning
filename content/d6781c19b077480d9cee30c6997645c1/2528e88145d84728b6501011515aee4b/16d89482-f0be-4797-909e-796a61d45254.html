  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Simjacker is a vulnerability associated with a SIM card’s S@T browser (SIMalliance Toolbox Browser), a pre-installed software incorporated in SIM cards to provide a set of instructions. Attackers exploit this vulnerability in the S@T browser to perform various malicious activities such as capturing the device location, monitoring calls, gathering information such as IMEI, making fraudulent or expensive calls, sending premium-rate messages, forcing the device browser to connect to malicious websites, and performing DoS attacks to block SIM cards. The SIM card-based attack can be aggravated based on the victim’s device. The Simjacker attack is initiated by sending spyware-like code in the form of system or SIM card settings through an SMS to take complete control of the SIM card and mobile device to issue various commands without user interaction.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Steps involved in Simjacker attack</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">The attacker sends fraudulent SMS containing hidden code or instructions from a SIM Application Toolkit (STK)</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The victim receives the malicious SMS and the S@T browser on the SIM card automatically recognizes and processes the hidden instructions or code</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The injected code performs various activities on the device without the user’s consent</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The accomplice device receives the user information via SMS, which an attacker can use to track live locations, exfiltrate the device information, and perform many other malicious activities</li></ul></div>
