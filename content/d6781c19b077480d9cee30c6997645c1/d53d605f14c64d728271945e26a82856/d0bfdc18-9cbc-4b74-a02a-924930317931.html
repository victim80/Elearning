With a “work anywhere, anytime” strategy, the challenge for the BYOD trend is to secure the company’s data and meet compliance requirements.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>BYOD Benefits</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Adopting BYOD advantageous for the company as well as the employee. Some of the benefits of BYOD are discussed below:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Increased Productivity</strong>: Employees become experts in using their personal devices and this increases their productivity. In addition, users tend to upgrade their personal devices with cutting-edge technologies so that the enterprise can benefit from the latest features (both software and hardware) of the device.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Employee Satisfaction</strong>: By implementing BYOD, employees use devices of their own choice, which they invest in themselves without the company’s involvement. Moreover, employees are more comfortable with their personal devices, as they contain both personal data and corporate data, thus eliminating the usage of multiple devices.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Work Flexibility</strong>: By practicing BYOD, employees can carry a single device to satisfy their personal and professional needs. Work that is usually done in the office can be done from anywhere in the world, as employees are provided with access to the corporate data. BYOD users have more freedom, as their companies do not impose strict rules that they would have to follow when using company property. BYOD replaces the traditional client-server model with a mobile and cloud-centric strategy, which can have far-reaching benefits.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lower Costs</strong>: A business that adopts BYOD does not have to spend on devices but saves money, as employees purchase their own devices. In addition, the cost of data services shifts to employees who can take better care of their own property (device).</li></ul></div>
