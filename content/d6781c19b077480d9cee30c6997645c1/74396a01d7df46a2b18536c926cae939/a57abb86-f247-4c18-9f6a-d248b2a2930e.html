  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Employees connecting to the corporate network or accessing corporate data using their own mobile devices pose security risks to the organization. Some BYOD security risks are listed below:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sharing confidential data on unsecured networks</strong>: Employees might access corporate data via a public network. These connections may not be encrypted; sharing confidential data via an unsecured network may lead to data leakage.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data leakage and endpoint security issues</strong>: In this cloud-computing era, mobile devices are insecure endpoints with cloud connectivity. By synchronizing with organizational email or other apps, these mobile devices carry confidential information. If the device is lost, it could potentially expose all the corporate data.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Improperly disposing of devices</strong>: An improperly disposed of device could contain a wealth of sensitive information, such as financial information, credit card details, contact numbers, and corporate data. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the device does not contain any data before it is disposed of or passed on to others.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Support for many different device</strong><strong>s</strong>: Organizations allow employees to access its resources from anywhere in the world, enhancing productivity and driving employee satisfaction. However, support for different devices and processes can increase costs. Employee-owned devices have limited security and come with a variety of platforms. This impedes the IT department’s capability to manage and control all the devices in a company.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mixing personal and private data</strong>: Mixing personal and corporate data on mobile devices leads to serious security and privacy implications. Therefore, it is a good practice to keep the corporate data separate from the employee’s personal data; this helps an organization to apply specific security measures such as encryption to protect the critical corporate data stored on the mobile device. In addition, it becomes easy for the organization to remotely wipe the corporate data without affecting the employee’s personal data when an employee leaves the organization.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lost or stolen devices</strong>: Due to their small size, mobile devices are often lost or stolen. When an employee loses his/her mobile device that is used for both personal and official purposes, the organization might face a security risk, as attackers can compromise the corporate data stored in the lost device.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lack of awareness</strong>: Organizations must educate their employees regarding BYOD security issues. Failing to do so might result in compromising the corporate data stored in mobile devices.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ability to bypass organization’s network policy rules</strong>: According to their particular requirements, the policies imposed may differ between wired networks and wireless networks. BYOD devices connected to wireless networks have the ability to bypass the organization’s network policy rules enforced only on wired LANs.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Infrastructure issues</strong>: A BYOD program involves dealing with various platforms and technologies. Not all employees carry the same devices. Different devices, each running different OS and programs, come with their own security loopholes. Thus, it can be problematic for an IT department to set up and maintain infrastructure to support different devices’ needs, such as managing data, security, backup, and compatibility among devices.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Disgruntled employees</strong>: Disgruntled employees in an organization can misuse corporate data stored on their mobile devices. They may also leak sensitive information to competitors.</li></ul></div>
