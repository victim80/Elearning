  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Signaling System 7 (SS7) is a communication protocol that allows mobile users to exchange communication through another cellular network (especially when roaming). Mobile devices are meant to be carried across different locations to serve their users. Changing the telecom operator or using the network of another cell tower is allowed via the SS7 protocol. This signaling mechanism is operated depending on mutual trust between the operators, without any authentication verification. Since the SS7 signaling network is not isolated, the attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform an MITM attack by impeding text messages and calls between the communicating devices. The attacker can eavesdrop on bank credentials, OTPs and other sensitive information routed through the network. This vulnerability in SS7 can also allow the attacker to bypass two-factor authentication and end-to-end encryption via SMS.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Threats Associated with SS7 vulnerability</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">When the attacker gains access to the SS7 protocol, the victim’s device faces the following risks:</p><ul><li>Exposing the subscriber’s identity</li><li>Revealing the network identity</li><li>Spying on and intercepting the network to steal personal data</li><li>Allowing phone tapping</li><li>Performing DoS attacks to damage the reputation of the target telecom operator</li><li>Tracking geographic locations</li></ul></div>
