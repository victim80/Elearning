  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Mobile applications are computer programs designed to run on smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices. Such applications include text messaging, email, playing videos and music, voice recording, games, banking, shopping, and so on. In general, apps are made available via application distribution platforms, which could be official app stores operated by the owners of mobile OS, such as Apple’s App Store, Google Play app store, and Microsoft App Store, or third-party app stores such as Amazon Appstore, GetJar, and APKMirror.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">App stores are common targets for attackers who seek to distribute malware and malicious apps. Attackers may download a legitimate app, repackage it with malware, and upload it to a third-party app store, from which users download it, considering it to be genuine. Malicious apps installed on user systems can damage other applications or stored data and send sensitive data such as call logs, photos, videos, sensitive docs, and so on to the attacker without the users’ knowledge. Attackers may use the information gathered to exploit the devices and launch further attacks. Attackers can also perform social engineering, which forces users to download and run apps outside the official app stores. Insufficient or no vetting of apps usually leads to the entry of malicious and fake apps in the marketplace. Malicious apps can damage other applications and data and send users’ sensitive data to attackers.</p></div>
